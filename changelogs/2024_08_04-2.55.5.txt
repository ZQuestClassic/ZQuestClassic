# Features


zc: add opt-in automation for uploading replays
  When enabled, once a week replays are uploaded to a server when the
  program exits. Only replays of known quests from the database are
  uploaded. There is also an option to manually trigger this process
  rather than enabling it automatically.
  
  Please consider enabling this, as it greatly helps out with development
  by allowing us to prevent bugs. This is important for any new features
  we add, but extremely so for the upcoming Z3 scrolling overhaul.
  
  See `docs/replays.md` for more information about the replay system.


# Bug Fixes

avoid crash when loading midi using native file dialog
capture allegro 5 systems logging in allegro.log
crash in native file picker from bad string
sprite drawing not deleting all bitmaps it created
crash when file prompt initial path has no slash
zc: kill all sound effects for passageways, item cellars, and when stepping out of a warp
zc: [windows] save path being cut off in log
zc: resolve replay qst against quests dir, handle missing file better
zc: prevent replay save from happening on title screen
zc: also save replay when selecting Quit Without Saving
zc: shadows for rocks and boulders not drawing

zq: [windows] Load Tileset with native file dialog no longer busted
zq: wording consistency issue (`trigger` should refer to the `Triggers` tab)

zq: some number entries (using SWAP_ZSINT_NO_DEC) being broken.
  Notably fixes many spots in the "Insert SCC" dialog, and some in combo wizards.

zq: death/spawn sprites not properly updating on tile move
zq: mark ffc count dirty when using Paste Special > FFC
  This was preventing FFCs from being retained on a screen when using
  the special FFC paste mode.

zq: restore proper animation speed for combos in screen view
launcher: remove defunct "Allow Multiple Instances" option

enable type-limits diagnostic as error, fix many issues found

# Refactors

zc: remove epilipsey dialog on fresh install, add toggle in launcher
zc: remove prompt about recording when starting a new save file
zq: add sub-menu for changing tile color depth

zscript: remove unused greyscale and monochrome filters
  Removes these methods:
  
  * `Graphics->Greyscale()`
  * `Graphics->Monochrome()`
  * `Game->GreyscaleOff()`
  * `Game->GreyscaleOn()`
  
  None of these are used in published quests, `Graphics->Tint()` and
  `Graphics->MonochromeHue()` can be used instead, and removing these
  simplifies some rendering logic.

zscript: remove option to configure run function name

# Misc.

zc: add qst_title, qst_hash as replay meta fields

# Features

option to disable transparent darkrooms stacking multiple transparent layers

show bottom 8 pixels
  The bottom 8 pixels of the screen has always been hidden. This was
  considered to be a universally bad thing, so they are now visible. A
  compat quest rule is added to control this behavior.
  
  When the bottom 8 pixels are enabled, active subscreens are still just
  168 pixels tall. Instead, active subscreens travel an extra 8 pixels
  when opened.
  
  ZC Player has a setting to configure this too. By default, it defers to
  the QR as defined in the quest, but users can override this.

zq: 'Reference Tiles'
  In the tile pages, 'RClick->Set as Reference'. This tile will now display
  on the left-hand side while editing any other tile, as a reference.

zscript: Allow '_' to be used as a spacer in numbers
  Ex. 100_000 == 100000, 2_147_483_647L = 2147483647L, 0b10_10_10_10 == 0b10101010

zscript: add `Game->HeroScreen`
  In 2.55, this is always equal to `Game->CurScreen`. In 3.0, this updates
  as the player moves around. Added to 2.55 for script compatability.

zscript: add `Screen->Index`
  In 2.55, this is always equal to `Game->CurScreen`. In 3.0 scrolling
  regions, the value of this varies depending on the context (for example,
  an npc script will have this set to the screen the enemy spawned on).

zscript: add `itemdata::FlashCSet`, improve `itemdata::CSet`
  `itemdata::CSet` contained both the normal and flash csets, and required
  bitwise operations to access. It also didn't allow for setting the flash
  cset. Now, `itemdata::CSet` is only for the normal cset, and the flash
  cset uses the new `itemdata::FlashCSet`.

zscript: add `Viewport`
  This global represents the currently visible playing field. In 2.55,
  this is all read-only and only changes during scroll transitions. In
  3.0, the visible viewport can be modified by scripts, and updates as the
  player moves around a scrolling region.

zscript: add `Screen->DrawOrigin`
  Determines how coordinates given to Screen drawing functions are
  interpreted. For more, see: https://docs.zquestclassic.com/zscript/globals/screen#globals-screen-var-draworigin

zscript: more value range types (.., =.., ..=, =..=)
zscript: add `ComboAdjust` for getting combo position offset by some pixels

# Bug Fixes


System menu mouse responsiveness
  Holding left-click and dragging across menus now allows going through
  multiple 'submenus' at once, including going back up to clicked-on
  parent menus. These were features of the old menu system, which were
  lost during the system upgrade.

prevent crash when loading midi with 32 tracks
actually fix loading tile data for old 1.90 quests
  2.55.7 (commit be55516) attempted to fix this, but used the wrong path
  to the classic quest. This commit fixes the path, but uses a new qst
  file with only the tile data (since classic_1st.qst is going to be
  removed).

zc: 'Platform' ffcs teleporting the player as the screen loads
zc: Game time shows in-game, even when you've 'cheated'
zc: show hero position in minimap for most special screens
  In the original Zelda, the dot in the minimap rendered even in special
  screens, except for dungeon passageways. ZC was never rendering for any
  special screens. Now, even item cellar / guy special rooms will render
  the dot on the screen the player came from.

zc: update dmap charted state more reliably
zc: fix bad memory access when checking for sword tap
zc: prevent OOB related to bridges in `HeroClass::checkchest`
zc: prevent many crashes related to sprite list being full
zc: off-by-one error in y-position world bounds for a few hero attacks

  Relevant changes:
    fix(zc): more off-by-one errors
zc: F5 map snapshot works again
zc: some collision issues related to 4-way movement with no-gridlock enabled.
zc: broken 'Z_Eventlog` output related to ExStates
zc: prevent crash when loading save files from 3.0
zq: lockblock/chest combo wizard bad field for counter amount
zq: Mixed weapon listers now show 'E ' before enemy weapons
  Previously, they would, ex., list 'Magic' twice, once for the lweapon and once for the eweapon.
  This changes it to list 'Magic' and 'E Magic' separately.
  This does NOT change listers showing only eweapons, such as the enemy editor's attack field.

zq: 'BtnCounter' subscreen widget ui was crunched
std_zh: wrap angle in `AngleDir4` and `AngleDir8`
zscript: keep modifications made during last frames before scrolling
  When scrolling between screens, scripts can run for a few frames just
  before scrolling begins, but modifications to the temporary screen were
  not persisting during the actual scroll.

zscript: prevent many out-of-bounds reads/writes
zscript: use correct upper limit when setting itemdata Tile
zscript: properly revert scope when processing class

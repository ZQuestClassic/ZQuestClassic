# Features

Torch combos support shapes, dirs, new Square shape.
  Also refactor how shape drawing works to remove the need for duplicate ZQ versions.

Add general SFX/Sprites to combos (no zscript access yet)
add solid damage combo QRs
  also fixed "No Solid Damage Combos" QR and fixed more issues with Newer Hero Movement

Customize 'Guy' per-room (compat ruled)
multiple new options related to subscreen item selection
  - Cursor can be allowed to select empty slots (Freeform Subscreen
  Cursor)
  - Can be set to require pressing B to equip (Always Press To Equip)
  - Items have 'Non-equippable' flag, allowing them to be cursor-selected
  without allowing them on buttons.

add quest package export for standalone app
  In the ZQuest `File -> Export` menu, there is a new option to package your
  `.qst` file as a standalone application. This gives you the option to
  distribute your quest in a way that allows people to play without
  grabbing any other files, or needing to select a file when starting a
  save slot.
  
  For a qst `game.qst` with a title "My Game", it looks like this:
  
  ```
  - My Game
  	- My Game.exe
  	- data/
  		- zelda.exe
  		- zc_args.txt
  		- game.qst
  		- ... all support files ...
  ```
  
  This is located in the `packages` folder of the root installation folder.
  
  Double clicking `My Game.exe` launches `./data/zelda.exe` with the CLI
  switches listed in `zc_args.txt`. By default, the export tool provides
  these switches: `-only game.qst -notitle`. You can set whatever else
  you like. For example, if you want to skip the save file screen entirely,
  you can use `-standalone` instead of `-only`.
  
  Every time a package export is done in ZQuest, the folder is created
  from scratch.
  
  To include additional files, make a folder `./packages/My Game_extra`
  and place whatever your quest needs (music, images, `zc_args.txt`,
  `zc.cfg`, etc). The export tool will copy this folder into the package
  folder at the end, which allows you to overwrite whatever you want.
  
  Custom icons are also supported. See `docs/packaging_quests.md` for details.

add -window-title switch
zq: 'Quick Compile ZScript' favorite command
zq: Option to auto-recompile when saving quest
zq: save autolayer info to reapply to blue void screens as a default
zscript: Add script access to draw lights (circle, cone, or square) arbitrarily.
zscript: '@InitScript(int weight)' annotation allows multiple global init scripts (all merged into ~Init).
zscript: jit compile MULTV
zscript: JIT compile scripts with background threads
  Control how many threads are used with `[ZSCRIPT] jit_threads`.
  
  ```ini
  # Number of background threads for compiling scripts.
  # -1 to set to number of available CPU threads
  # -x to set to x/(number of available CPU threads)
  # 0 to only compile on the main thread
  jit_threads = -2
  ```

vscode: create VS Code extension
  This adds support to VS Code for displaying error/warning messages,
  syntax highlighting, and code formatting. You can install it by
  searching for "zscript" in the extensions Marketplace. See the extension
  homepage for more:

# Bug Fixes

memory leak when allegro does not find file
for linux, use posix_spawnp when launching processes
set dirty flag for vedit text field components
bad ternary from solid damage commit
ZQ doesn't lock up if parser crashes [windows only]
properly set sentry breadcrumb category
add win7 compat for GetOverlappedResults
zc: reset button down state correctly
zc: 'npc->Remove()' no longer leaves behind enemy bg sfx
zc: clear darkroom bitmaps to dark color during player death animation
zc: Lantern inconsistency during scrolling caused by previous commit
zc: memory leak in read_one_subscreen
zc: more reproducible fairy hearts, for replay in Debug mode
zc: various newer hero movement
zc: new respawn points with ladder
zc: check for invalid screen index in subscreen map draw
zc: reduce some data races
zc: smart conveyors snapping you to the grid
zc: Crash related to reflected magic having invalid parent

zc: specific NES door softlock
  softlock when moving through a bombable or walk-through door *in mid-air* with "No Scrolling Screen While In Air" enabled.
  (Now, with this rule on, you won't be able to go through the door until you land)

zc: input prompt not showing when configuring gamepad
zc: prevent invalid memory access in triggerfire
zc: prevent invalid memory access in joytn
zq: set list position for strings of older quests
  This resulted in the Strings GUI not correctly showing all the strings.

zq: use correct index when saving string editor "Next"
zq: some pasting/blue void screen related issues
zq: blue void issues related to F4 (screen palette) dialog
zq: grabbing tiles from qst files
  Commit `142485` regressed this, by accidentally throwing out the next
  section id when skipping unwanted sections.

zscript: global object arrays being wrongly cleared on F6->Continue
zscript: fix for-each loops on non-const arrays.
zscript: free jit script handles on engine shutdown
zscript: Negative Array rule issues
  Fixed negative array rule not being respected on first load of game (either via test quest or when loading from file select); also fixed negative array rule not being turned on via compat.

zscript: compile crash
zscript: several class related bugs
zscript: QUOTEDSTRINGs not merging for all use cases (ex. annotations)
zscript: screen script run function arguments
zscript: shutdown jit thread pool before resetting scripts
  This prevents a segfault when a thread is compiling some old script
  after a new quest has loaded.

zscript: Broken labels and stack size in global init scripts
zscript: more string literal related issues
  also added macros to help fix more of these that might pop up

zscript: prevent MODR divide-by-zero in jit
zscript: make div-by-zero an error instead of a warning, when divisor is literal 0
zscript: script engine hanging on empty script
vscode: support missing edge case for parsing error

# Documentation

zscript: docs for light-related new drawing functions, LIGHT_SQUARE constant

# Build


remove alogg, use a5 audio streams for ogg
  Also refactors zcmusic to use `ALSTREAMFILE` for any a5 audio stream.
  Currently, mp3 and ogg use this.

# Refactors


un-inline zc_math functions
  This allows for us to always optimize these functions, even for Debug
  builds. Good for replay determinism.

actually skip reading qst sections when requested
  Only the tile importer for qst files uses the feature of skipping
  sections when loading a qst file. This would still read and process
  every section, it just wouldn't persist anything. So it wasn't really
  any quicker.
  
  This paves the way for removing `keepdata` from all of our loading code.

add 'qrs.h','qrs.cpp' and move 'box_' related functions
optimize some more headers/zdefs stuff
move Hotkey struct to 'hotkey.h'/'hotkey.cpp'
move dmap struct/flags to 'dmap.h', various constants to 'sizes.h'
move packfile-related functions to 'packfile.h'
move combo pool/alias data to 'cpool.h'/'cpool.cpp'
move font enum to 'fonts.h'
move MsgStr stuff to 'msgstr.h'/'msgstr.cpp'
move newcombo stuff to 'combo.h'/'combo.cpp'
move combo 'advanced paste' to 'combo.cpp', use enum flags, rename 'sizes.h' to 'general.h'
move triggerflags to combo.h
move misc data stuff to 'misctypes.h'/'misctypes.cpp'
only use 'QMisc' as a single global 'miscQdata' for all programs
remove keepdata boolean from packfile reading
zc: remove windows midi_patch; improve switch out/in
  This code was pausing/restarting MIDIs and resetting the volume in a
  convulted manner, likely to workaround some old bug with MIDIs seen on
  windows only. We've since upgraded to allegro 5, which gives a different
  backend for playing MIDIs, so this bug is likely ancient history now.
  
  There was some issue with blurring window focus losing percussion,
  sometimes. Not sure if this change will have an impact, but let's see.
  
  Replaced the midi_patch UI toggle with pause_in_background.

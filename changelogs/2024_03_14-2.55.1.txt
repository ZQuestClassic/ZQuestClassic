# Bug Fixes

generic script InitD[] not working at all
increase sfx buffer to prevent "Out of buffers" log spam
zc: improve replay stop process for update mode
zc: check if save slot is valid before loading
zc: fix crash in Options>Snapshot Format
zq: minor typo in Export DMaps title

zq: correctly handle variable length title in all dmap reading/writing
  6bd8a9a added support for variable length dmap titles, but only for the
  main dmap reading/writing code. This functionality is duplicated across
  dmap import/export and other places, but wasn't updated.

zscript: verify first index for screen_d
  This fixes a crash in Titan's Gate.

launcher: "Static for invalid data" option not working in zlauncher

# Tests

include palette in gfx frame hash

fix hash for compare replay image dedupe
  The previous hash did not take into account the image format's color
  palette, so hash collisions prevented some failing frames from showing.

fix --split-threshold cli arg for split_replay.py
add the_deep.zplay
add enigma_of_basilischi_island_basilse.zplay

# CI

upload releases to s3 bucket

# Misc.

add min replay size threshold when splitting replays

zscript: class variables not shadowing global vars properly
zscript: some wrong error messages related to mapdata FFC access
zscript: disallow casting custom objects to unrelated types
  A bug in type conversion allowed this code to compile:
  
  ```c++
  Object obj = new Object();
  int number = obj;
  int numbers[] = {obj};
  ```
  
  The above code now produces a compiler error.

# Documentation

zscript: add documentation regarding 'Hero->Warp()' and its return square

# Refactors

zscript: better 'read-only' compile warnings

zscript: deprecate many getters/setters, replace with variables
  ~40 built-in methods exist in this style:
  
  ```c++
  int Max(); // Returns the max.
  void Max(int value); // Sets the max.
  int GetCurDMapScreen();
  ```
  
  These have been deprecated and replaced with a variable, like so:
  
  ```
  int Max; // The max number.
  int CurDMapScreen;
  ```

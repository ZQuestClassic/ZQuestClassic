# Features

add 'Note' item wizard, notes can play relative strings now
add enemy flag to control if affected by "Kill All Enemies"

add option to use the native OS dialog to select/create files
  A new button allows using the OS dialog to select/create a file. This
  can be used directly by setting the `Native File Dialog` option in the
  launcher.

zq: show CSet in combo pages
zq: hex entry for string control code dialog
zscript: allow function return and parameter types to use `[]`
  This doesn't enforce array types, but allows 3.0 scripts to be
  backwards-compatabile with 2.55


# Bug Fixes


zc: npc scripts for many enemies ending after one frame
  Enemies larger than one tile use a different code path than other enemies,
  and that path was mistakenly only allowing scripts to run for a single frame.

zq: prevent invalid string access resulting in crash
launcher: hide update tab on linux

# Build

add cmake install commands for linux
update GME, which should resolve the final gcc build issue
set default install folder on linux to ~/zquestclassic
generate changelog when doing linux install

# Refactors


remove expensive busy loop in render throttler
  Replaces a busy loop with a much cheaper mutex condition variable to
  control FPS.
  
  The `maxfps` option now works for values less than 60 fps.

zc: add cache to generation of translucency tables
  This took up a lot of CPU time during the titlescreen and during
  animations such as screen wipes / triforce pickup / etc.

std_zh: delete unused and unwanted stuff
  These files have been deleted from the `std` library:
  
  * std_zh/assert.zh
  * std_zh/astar.zh
  * std_zh/infostring.zh
  * std_zh/math.zh
  * std_zh/std_legacy.zh
  * std_zh/std_meta.zh
  * std_zh/std_update.zh
  * std_zh/std_user_defs.zh
  * std_zh/std_vars.zh
  * std_zh/weapon.zh
  
  These files either do not belong in a standard library (too specific),
  are not finished, or otherwise provide little to no value so are just
  a maintenance burden.

zscript: reduce the scripts included by default
  This removes some scripts that aren't useful, or aren't a good fit for
  default inclusion.
  
  * delete `gameover_menus.zh`
  * delete `LISP.zh`
  * delete `Music.zh`
  * delete `sprites.zh`
  * delete `styles.zh`
  * delete `theRandomHeader_v2.zh`
  * delete `ZVersion.zh`
  * delete `tango/1.0` and `tango/1.2` (keeping just 1.3)
  * move `sram.zh` to `deprecated/sram.zh`
  * move `theRandomHeader_v3.zh` to `deprecated/theRandomHeader.zh`
  * move `time.zh` to `deprecated/time.zh`
  * move example scripts to `headers/examples`
  * remove `std` including `EmilyMisc.zh` - include yourself as needed

# Features


configurable charge step for enemy rope walk style (#953)
  If "Walk Attr." (aka misc attribute 10) is >0, enemies with the "Rope" walk style will use that custom value
  for the charging step.

use allegro 5 for DUMB tracker audio (mod, it, s3m, xm)
  The listed tracker formats now support setting loop points in the DMap
  Music tab, including setting the speed / position in ZScript. Note, the
  only enhanced music formats that do not support these features now are:
  spc, gbs, vgm, gym, and nsf.
  
  This also happens to fix an issue where tracks that have builtin loops
  were incorrectly playing silence before looping.

support delete keyboard shortcuts for most text controls
  * Ctrl+Backspace (Mac: Opt+Backspace) - deletes from cursor to next word
    boundrary
  * Alt+Backspace (Mac: Cmd+Backspace) - deletes from cursor to beginning
    of the line


# Bug Fixes

improve key input latency by simplifying d_vsync_proc
call allegro_exit before exit to avoid rare hang seen on linux
generate correct version string for 1.92 quests
ctrl+a,c,v work again in text fields

use correct conversion from 6-bit to 8-bit colors
  Multiple places converted 6-bit colors to 8-bit by just multiplying by
  4, which is wrong (ex: 63 * 4 = 252, but 255 is expected). Now we use a
  lookup table. This fixes:
  
  * The hex color shown in palette and tile editors
  * various components drawn in the editor (like the minimap)
  * exporting jpg images

prevent crash when deleting all text in some input fields
zc: Damage combos with Custom Damage not working on FFCs
zc: correctly restore sword/potion/triforce items with fairies in pre-2.55 quests
zc: restore palette after wavy effect
  The wavy effect was leaving the palette slightly off what it should
  have been, which was making the colors slightly saturated until the
  next time the palette changed.

zc: do not ignore replay forever if save has not been played yet
zc: draw decorations correctly during scrolling
  Some decorations (like combo sprites) are drawn without the correct
  offset during screen scrolling, and worse were not disappearing after
  the end of the scroll (not until its animation naturally finished). Now
  these decoration sprites are drawn correctly during scrolling, and get
  removed.

zc: lockblocks on layer 0 no longer ignored in cave dmaps if locked door present

zc: pause music when opening player data with cheat shortcut
zc: avoid crash in Go To cheat by checking destination is valid
  This cheat dialog expects you to input the screen number before any DMap
  xoff is applied, which can result in directing the game to load an
  invalid screen and crash. Now the screen is validated, and the xoff
  is displayed next to each DMap in the dropdown.

zc: fire trail weapons glow in dark rooms, just like flames
zq: prevent dmap editor crash when map is no longer valid
zq: prevent various quest report crashes
zq: set the default values for patra's (2 and 3) inner eyes
zq: reduce latency on combo page paste
zscript: scripts no longer use wrong context after many sprites created
  After 65536 sprites have been created without closing the player, the ID
  of subsequent sprites was too high for how the internal script engine
  stored the state for each script. This resulted in randomly using some
  other script's state, causing general mayhem.

zscript: LoadDirectory always failing due to bad path validation

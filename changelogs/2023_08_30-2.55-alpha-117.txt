# Features

Add 75 new 'Custom Counters' (26-100)

Music and sound stuff galore!
  
  - Enhanced music using MP3 and OGG can now be given loop points and crossfade timings in the DMap editor. The music will then loop at those points and fade in and out with those timings.
  - Scripts have new ways to interact with enhanced music: GetMusicPos(), SetMusicPos(), SetMusicSpeed(), GetMusicLength(), and SetMusicLoop()
  - Scripts can also play music with crossfades using CrossfadeEnhancedMusic().
  - Scripts can play sounds with different, volume, pan, frequency, and looping with PlaySoundEx().
  
  ```c
  // Turns a SFX into an instrument by playing it back at different frequencies
  ffc script Piano
  {
      void run()
      {
          // Frequency values and keys for different notes
          int hz[] =   {16350L, 17320L, 18350L, 19450L, 20600L, 21830L, 23120L, 24500L, 25960L, 27500L, 29140L, 30870L, 32700L};
          int keys[] = {KEY_Z,  KEY_S,  KEY_X,  KEY_D,  KEY_C,  KEY_V,  KEY_G,  KEY_B,  KEY_H,  KEY_N,  KEY_J,  KEY_M,  KEY_COMMA};
          int sz = SizeOfArray(hz);
          int sfx = Rand(60); // Pick a random SFX
          while(true)
          {
              for(int i=0; i<sz; ++i)
              {
                  if(Input->KeyPress[keys[i]])
                  {
                      int j = (hz[i]/hz[0]) * 22050L; // Multiply by the sample rate of most default SFX
                      Audio->PlaySoundEx(sfx, 100, 0, j);
                  }
              }
  
              Waitframe();
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  - Scripts can also adjust sounds mid playback with AdjustSound() and track their completion with GetSoundCompletion().
  
  ```c
  ffc script AdjustSound
  {
      void run()
      {
          // Play the sound panned to the left at half volume
          Audio->PlaySoundEx(SFX_SECRET, 50, -128, -1, false);
          // Run until the sound has stopped playing
          while(Audio->GetSoundCompletion(SFX_SECRET)!=-1)
          {
              int pct = Audio->GetSoundCompletion(SFX_SECRET) / 100;
              // Pan the sound to the right while increasing in volume
              Audio->AdjustSound(SFX_SECRET, Lerp(50, 100, pct), Lerp(-128, 127, pct), -1, false);
              Waitframe();
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  - Scripts can set MusicRefresh to prevent music from resetting when changing screens
  ```c
  Audio->PlayEnhancedMusic("ExampleSong.ogg", 0);
  Audio->MusicRefresh = MR_DMAP; // Music will refresh on changing DMap
  Audio->MusicRefreshFlags[MRF_REVERT] = true; // Music refresh with revert to default behavior afterwards
  ```
  
  - AdjustMusicVolume() and AdjustSFXVolume() have been reworked to be a multiplier capped at the user's volume settings, rather than overwriting those settings.

Can now disable pushblock draw layer [QR `Pushable Block Sprite Layer`]
add software updater
  ZUpdater looks for the newest versions, and allows you to download
  and replace your current installation with it.
  
  You can run `zupdater.exe` directly, or you can use the new "Update" tab
  in ZLauncher. ZLauncher also has an option to auto-focus the tab on
  startup if a new version is detected.
  
  Note: this feature currently requires Python 3 to be installed.
  
  Also: drive-by fixes for launching a process on unix, though the updater
  feature doesn't use this.


  Relevant changes:
    feat: add software updater
    feat(launcher): re-open launcher after update
    test: re-enable updater test
Add 'Game->OverrideItems[]' to allow forcing an item id to be "highest level owned" of its' class.
One-line minimap titles, 'Preview DMap' for subscreen editor

setting for subscreen widgets to hide during message strings
parser timeout is now configurable/disablable (instead of 30sec)
expand combo initd to [8]
walk-through nes doors now set door states when used
allow closing program with (most) dialogs open. (clean up gui functions too)
add 'Button Counter' subscreen widget type
'No Unequip' flag for subscreen itemslot widgets
new subscreen selector options (per-widget and subscreen-wide)
zc: split saves into individual files
  Each save slot created is now stored in a separate file, kept in the
  `saves/` folder. This path is configurable with `[zeldadx] save_folder`.
  
  An existing `zc.sav` file is split into individual files, and the
  original is moved to `saves/backup`.
  
  The order of the save slots is maintained by `saves/order.txt`. You may
  freely rearrange the lines of this text file, though you must do so when
  the program is not open for it to have any effect.
  
  Any save file that gets deleted will simply be moved to `saves/deleted`.
  If you ever want it truly gone, you can delete the folder yourself. If
  you want to restore it, just move it back to `saves/`.
  
  Individual save files are only loaded into memory as needed, and only
  partially if only needed to display info on the title screen (like the
  name, icon, hearts, etc).
  
  The `-standalone` switch still works the same, but the save file is at
  `saves/standalone.sav`.

zc: change save slot limit from 15 to ∞
zc: copy save file to backup folder on every save
zc: support more than one qst file for -standalone mode
  Previously, standalone mode only worked for a single quest file at a
  time. For example, run `-standalone game.qst` once and `game.qst`
  becomes the only quest that will work with the save file generated. Now,
  each quest will use a save file derived from the name of the quest file.
  
  You can also provide a specific path if you like. It will be resolved
  relative to the `save/` folder (you can also use an absolute path).
  Example usage: `-standalone game.qst me.sav`

zc: record music and sfx position for scripts in replays
zc: configure primary and secondary gamepad stick in settings
zc: select one of multiple gamepads in settings
zc: add option to auto-restart in test mode when qst is saved in zquest
zq: Remember 'View Layer 2/3 as BG' setting
zq: add Shift+Minus/Plus for changing combo in combo editor
zq: configure multiple init datas for test mode
  Test Mode now allows you to customize test-only init data. You can make
  multiple init datas. They are saved to your `zquest.cfg`. A basic name
  is auto-assigned, but you can set your own name by modifying your
  config.
  
  When you create a new test init data, your current quest's init data is
  used as the starting point. Later modifying the quest init data has no
  impact on your test init datas.
  
  You can also directly modify the init data values in the config, though
  the format is not documented anywhere.

zq: save test init data per-quest
zq: made side warps for new screens default to Scrolling warps
zq: side warp triggers cycle backwards with right click
zq: "Set All" buttons for screen state carryovers
zq: Smart Assign Slots in zscript compile
zq: ctrl+clicking a tile selector goes to previously selected tile
std_zh: add 'GetLevelSwitchState()'/'SetLevelSwitchState()' helper functions
std_zh: item_tile/item_cset animation helpers in EmilyMisc.zh
zscript: special layer for non-overhead ffc draws
zscript: Add special layer timings related to lens of truth
zscript: Add 'Game->TrigGroups[]' read-only array
zscript: Variadic Parameters (user functions)
zscript: printfa/sprintfa to take an array of args like printf/sprintf
zscript: Allow declaring size 0 arrays
zscript: Game->CurrentItemID() to use the engine method of checking owned items.
zscript: Array Push/Pop functions
zscript: ArrayPushAt/ArrayPopAt for arbitrary index push/pop
vscode: add "Always Include" setting, default ["std.zh"]
  This takes an array of files to always '#include', so that you don't need to manually add the #include to every one of your files.

vscode: better working 'alwaysInclude', clean error messages for other-file errors
vscode: better CONST_ASSERT handling, setting to ignore CONST_ASSERT errors
vscode: use default options NO_ERROR_HALT, HEADER_GUARD for language server compiles
vscode: add includepaths option
launcher: add button to view current release notes
web: support music crossfading, set position, set speed
  This drops the web-specific implementation of zcmusic via SDL_mixer. It
  was only done that way because we weren't building any sound libraries
  from source, so using emscripten's port system + SDL_mixer was a
  workaround. But SDL_mixer only supports a single music channel, so it
  cannot do crossfading, so it's time to drop it.


# Bug Fixes

cutscene combos being incompatible with replays
set exe path string to empty if fail to get exe path
changer ffc interactions, ffc timer interactions

use ut8 encoding for config and filenames
  Config values can now carry non-ascii values. This required also configuring
  allegro to treat file paths as UTF8.
  
  Fonts have varying support for characters outside ASCII characters.
  Probably we currently have no fonts that adequately cover non-latin
  characters. While you may see gibberish in the file picker, files should
  still load just fine.

pushable blocks not respecting lens layer hiding/revealing
support leading dot in file selector filter
  This recently broke loading zplay files because the constant for the
  extension changed from `zplay` to `.zplay`, and the old file selector
  expect no leading dot, unlike every other file path API known to man.

dmap music with crossfades was not setting loop points
Allow exiting zc when test mode gets stuck in error
some bad dialog 'default's resulting in windows closing
event crash due to bad weapon access
checkbox odd alignment issues
test quest dlg wrong button focus
add some missing properties to init data delta

zq: use gui list data getter for init data dmap
zq: use correct int size when reading qst template size
zq: door dialog now updates visually on dropdown modify
zq: write to temp file when saving qst and rename when done

zc: split save code from title.cpp, remove .icn
  .icn files contained just the color data for each ring variant needed
  by the title screen. The idea was to avoid loading each quest just to
  show a single tile graphic. But, this same data is already in the gamedata
  save structure, so we don't need to maintained a separate file doing the same.
  The greatly simplifies much of the code dealing with displaying these icons.

# Full Subscreen Rewrite
The entire code behind how the subscreen functions has been entirely reworked to be less janky and more manageable. This makes editing the subscreen further a LOT easier of a task for us, and makes everything just a lot nicer in general.

## General mechanics tweaks
Several mechanics have been generally tweaked, including basic things like how the selector behaves and how items are equipped. These changes are mostly spread across a variety of quest rules, but for easy swapping, there are now "New Subscreen" and "Old Subscreen" Rule Templates available [see Quest->Options->Pick Rule Templates]. These change almost every new rule related to the subscreen - the only important one that they leave alone is `Old Gauge Tile Layout`, which changes the tile layout used by Gauge Piece widgets.

These new QRs, as well as many existing QRs that relate to the subscreen, have been moved to the new "Subscreen" tab. These are searchable as usual via the QR Search feature.

TL;DR New QRs, check the new Rule Templates or the Subscreen tab.

## Button Equipment Stuff
* QR 'No Button Verification'- if enabled, the engine will no longer auto-equip things to buttons for you.
* Also allows UNEQUIPPING items (try to equip it to the slot it's already equipped to)
* Problem: With this enabled, even if you start with items, now the engine won't equip any of them for you!
* Solution: Now you can set "Default Equipment" for each button slot! Just check the box in the ItemSlot widget, for the Active Subscreen that is set on the Starting DMap, and these items will begin pre-equipped to the buttons you set them to.

## Brand New Features
### Overlay Subscreens
These subscreens draw over the screen at all times, both during play and the active subscreen.
As usual, widgets can have the 'Display' settings on widgets to change their visibility while the active subscreen is up, down, and scrolling.
This can be used for various things, such as:
* Displaying your current keys over the corner of the game screen, either using a 'Counter' for a number of keys or a 'Gauge Piece: Counter' to actually physically display each key.
* Displaying button items or other similar widgets transparently over the game screen, similar to LTTP

### Active Subscreen: Pages
You can now add multiple PAGES to Active Subscreens! You can either set buttons (like L and R) to cycle pages, or trigger page transitions by pressing a button on an appropriately configured widget. Changing between pages will use one of currently 3 animation styles:
* Instant (It just jumps right to the other page)
* Slide (Both pages slide in the same direction, the current page going offscreen as the new page comes onscreen)
  * Direction and Speed (in px/frame, with 4 decimal places) are configurable for this transition type.
* Pixellate (Seemingly-but-not-actually random pixels from across the screen change bit by bit from the old page to the new page)
  * Duration is configurable for this type, in frames, as well as the "Invert", "XOffset", and "YOffset" parameters. These parameters only change the pattern of pixellation by altering the formula used to create the pixellation pattern.

By default, the Selector is not drawn during transitions- but this can be toggled as a checkbox on each transition.

### Select Any Widget
Instead of only being able to move the cursor to "Current Item" objects (now renamed to "Item Slot"), the cursor can now be set to move to ANY widget you want it to! This has some nice interactions with other new features....

### New Selector Features
The selected widget can now be set to:
* Have overridden selection text, which will be displayed in the "Selected Text" widget (formerly "Selected Item Name")
* Start a page transition animation on button press
* Run a generic frozen script on button press

Yes, you heard right, there is now SOME level of scripting on the engine subscreen, even if not much.

### Gauge Piece Rework
Life and Magic gauge pieces received a MASSIVE overhaul, and the "Gauge Piece: Counter" has been added to allow gauges for ANY counter! All of these behave identically to each other, except for these differences:
* Magic gauge still has the "Show Drain" property, which is used to make a gauge piece display conditionally based on your magic drain rate (ex. show the half magic symbol when you have half magic)
* Counter gauge lets you configure which counter to use, and how many per container to use for that gauge.
Aside from these differences, they ALL can:
* Specify a Gauge Wid/Hei, making a single widget draw _**more than one gauge piece**_, instead drawing an entire GRID of gauge pieces for you!
  * Specify an XOffset/YOffset to be applied to each row/column to create an offset-grid
  * Specify an HSpace/VSpace to space out the grid
  * Flags to specify which direction the grid "moves" in (Right to Left? Top to Bottom? Move in columns first, then rows? Snake back and forth?)
* Hide the gauge (Or only show the gauge) when you have the Infinite Item for this gauge (works the same way as counter infinite items)
* Specify a "Units per Frame" to reduce tile page usage. For instance, if "Units per Frame" is "2", then it uses half as many tiles for the gauge, as it uses the same tile for "1" as it would for "0", and the same for "2" as it would for "3", etc.
* Specify frames/speed/delay for an animated gauge
* Specify an animation CONDITION, wherein the gauge will only animate if it is above or below a certain value (either as a hard value, or as a percentage of being full). Additionally, you can specify it so that it skips the first frame of the animation when the condition is true.
  * A good example of how you can use this, is to have your life gauge only animate when your health is critically low, and use the skip first frame feature. This way, normally, your life gauge uses a single still tile- but when you reach critical life, it starts using the second tile in the animation instead (as well as any more if you supply more of an animation). This would allow for, say, cracked heart containers, blood dripping from heart containers, etc, as low-health visual effects.
* Specify "Full Tile" mode, which causes the gauge to use full tiles instead of mini-tiles, becoming twice as wide and twice as tall in the process.

### Counter Addition
Counters can now have a "Max Digits" specified, and if the counter has too large a value to fit in that many digits, it will instead display that many digits as all 9s.

## GUI Work
#### The Subscreen Lister
The dialog where you select which subscreen to edit is now upgraded to the new dialog system. This dialog now shows you _**3 separate lists**_ for the 3 different types of subscreen!

### The Subscreen Editor
* Now somewhat auto-resizes itself situationally. This means it will be smaller for passive subscreens, larger for overlay subscreens, and will adjust to font changes.
* Now has text displaying information about the currently copied widget
* When editing an Active Subscreen, a whole new set of buttons for adding/removing/changing Pages is present.
* R-Click menu has been entirely revamped, with many new options added.
* R-Click menu now also exists if r-clicking in a spot that has no widget, which previously would give no r-click menu at all.
* Slight tweaks to the existing menus
* New Menu: Options.
  * Options->Mouse Settings allows you to change how the mouse behaves in the subscreen editor. You can choose between "Classic" (for the old behavior), or "Modern" (the new default, reworked behavior). Notably, in the Modern behavior, you are able to click-and-drag widgets around the subscreen editor.
  * Subscreen Settings dialog, allows you to specify settings specific to the subscreen. Currently only has settings for Active Subscreens, where some settings related to swapping pages are housed.
* Several new "View" menu options, such as previewing what it would look like if every counter were full, or if every max counter was 65535, or if you had the "Infinite Item" for every counter, etc. Also includes an option to toggle "Show Unowned Items". If off, the editor display will show only the items as you have in Init Data.

### The Widget Properties Dialog
Slight spacing tweaks, every widget now has an additional tab for selection-related settings. More widgets will use tabs for formatting now, giving the dialog a bit more breathing room overall.

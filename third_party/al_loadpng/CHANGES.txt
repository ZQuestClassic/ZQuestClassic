------- April 1999 -------

??	Wrote load_png wrapper

??+1	Cleaned up a bit, tried getting grayscale and
	auto-MagicPink conversion working.

9	Now can read gamma from environment variable.
	Changed default gamma to 2.2.

13	Added save_png, using pieces from allpng.c

15	Fixed stupid bug I created in save_hicolour.
	Added copyright notice.
	Now uses packfile routines.
	Added #ifdef __cplusplus hack.
	Released: version 0.1.
	
------- December 1999 -------

22	Updated to work with Allegro 3.9.xx.
	Fixed alpha channel support.
	Added alpha.c
	test.c renamed to example.c
	Released: version 0.2

------- January 1999 -------

3	Applied fix for < 8 bpp images (thanks to Dave Dribin)
	Released: version 0.3
	
------- October 2000 -------

12	Updated const-correctness in accordance with Allegro.
	Released: version 0.4

------- April 2001 -------

11	"Fixed" RGB/BGR problem with loading RGBA images.
	Use GFX_AUTODETECT in examples (GFX_SAFE changed in Allegro).
	Released: version 0.5

------- July 2001 -------

13	Reverted to 0.4 codebase, as 0.5 was really broken (oops).
	Added "depth" argument to examples.
	Commented out the BGR flipping code, which was incorrect I think
	  anyway.  Someone with a BGR card should check it out.
	Released: version 0.6

------- January 2002 -------

03	allegro/aintern.h -> allegro/internal/aintern.h (Allegro 4.0)
	Released: version 0.7

------- February 2002 -------

25	Fixed a problem with passing NULL for pal to load_png.
	Released: version 0.8

------- March 2002 -------

30	Tentative fixes for loading/saving RGBA images.
	  Thanks to Chris Graham for reporting the problem.
	Minor changes to examples and makefile.

------- May 2002 -------

06	Added shared library (unix) and install support into makefiles, 
	  and cleaned them up.  Thanks to Robbert Haarman for the start.
	Minor changes for -W warnings.

07	Dave Dribin fixed a problem that surfaced with some buggy versions
	  of libpng (1.0.13, 1.2.2).
	Moved the thanks section into a separate document.

08	Fixed a puny mistake in the makefile.

12	Released: version 0.9

16	Tentative fixes for sometimes-problems loading RGB images.

19	Released: version 0.10

------- September 2002 -------

03	Dave Dribin fixed two problems with images with alpha channels.

04	Released: version 0.11

------- April 2003 -------

27	Mostly incorporated Ceniza's changes (load_memory_png and loading
	  from datafile support, plus an example).

28	Reworked those changes a little.

------- May 2003 -------

02	Miscellaneous changes; put examples into separate directory
	  (now that we have three!).

04	Signal errors on read/write failure.
	Released: version 1.0.

20	Calling load_png with NULL for palette argument was not converting
	  paletted images to high/truecolour properly.  Fixed.  Thanks to
	  Lothar May for pointing it out.
	Released: version 1.1.

------- October 2003 -------

13	Changed the method of scaling of palette values from 6 bits
	  to 8 bits.  Instead of just multiplying by 4, now we use
	  _rgb_scale_6[] so that e.g. 0 -> 0, but 63 -> 255.
	  Thanks Nicolas Lemal for the idea.
	Released: version 1.2.

16	MSVC doesn't like pointer arithmetic on void*'s, pointed out by
	  Chris Condrat.
	Re-released: version 1.2 (I forgot to update version constants anyway).

------- April 2004 -------

26	Jon Rafkind suggested to use _getpixel*/_putpixel* in loader to
	  speed up loading of large images.
	Split up the code into three files.  This prevents the linker pulling
	  in unused code, e.g. many people don't need save_png.

28	It turns out that loadpng's origin (example.c from libpng docs) was in
	  the public domain, so now loadpng is in the public domain as well.
	Released: version 1.3.

------- October 2004 -------

09	Made save_png handle non-memory bitmaps as well.

10	Fixed some bugs with load_png().  Now everything in PngSuite loads
	  properly, and with correct gamma correction, except for:
	  - bKGD chunks (solid background colours) are not respected.
            I chose this in the past, but I wonder if I should change it?
	  - pHYs chunks (physical dimensions) are not respected.
	  (BTW, this was all tested with Valgrind - no errors)

	_png_screen_gamma can now be 0.0 to disable gamma correction, i.e. if
	  you don't know the screen gamma, it might be best not to guess.

	Got rid of inefficient BGR-handling hack and did things properly.

	New example: browse.c (for mass testing, e.g. PngSuite)

	Released: version 1.4pre1.

------- August 2005 -------

18	Emmanuel Anne made _png_compression_level actually work.

	Released: version 1.4.

------- April 2006 -------

9	Fix an endianness on big-endian machines, from Siarhei Siamashka.
	I haven't tested it.

	Released: version 1.5.

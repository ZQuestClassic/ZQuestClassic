Building addons

All available addons are built automatically if all the required dependencies
are found. To disable building of the specific addon, set the appropriate CMake
variables to off.  You can use ccmake to browse the list of options.

Available addons

Since Allegro 4.4, several addon libraries are bundled in the Allegro package.
These are some of the most commonly used addons because they contain some
handy features that Allegro lacks. Hopefully, with these addons you will need
less additional libraries for your game.

One advantage of bundled addons is that their build system is integrated with
Allegro's build system. Addons are automatically configured, built, installed
and uninstalled with Allegro. However, you can perform these operations
separately for each addon, if that will better suit your needs.

Finally, if you think that some addons, in your opinion, should be included,
feel free to contact Allegro developers and we will consider your proposal.


@@   AllegroGL
  AllegroGL is an Allegro add-on that allows you to use OpenGL alongside
  Allegro -- you use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen, and Allegro for
  miscellaneous tasks like gathering input, doing timers, getting
  cross-platform portability, loading data, and drawing your textures. So
  this library fills the same hole that things like GLUT do.

  AllegroGL also automatically exposes most, if not all, OpenGL extensions
  available to user programs. This means you no longer have to manually load
  them; extension management is already done for you.

@@   loadpng
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a cool raster image file format. libpng is
  the reference library for working with PNG files. loadpng is some glue that
  makes it easy to use libpng to load and save bitmaps from Allegro programs.

  loadpng depends on zlib and libpng libraries. Instructions for getting and
  installing these can be found on loadpng webiste.

@@   logg
  LOGG is an Allegro  add-on library for playing OGG/Vorbis audio files. It can
  load OGG/Vorbis files as Allegro SAMPLE's, or it can stream them from disk to
  save memory.
  It depends on libogg and libvorbis, available from vorbis.com.

  and to save baseline JPGs. It is standalone (no dependencies except for

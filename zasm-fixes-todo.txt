Screen->TileWarpOverlayFlags/Screen->SideWarpOverlayFlags handle Combos Carry Over checkbox in the warp_dlg
	probably should be bool arrays


int TileWarpOverlayFlags;
 * Has to do with overlay of Link over/under combos (clipping?) with some warp types.
 * Probably needs to be an array [4].
 * Can we deduce wat this does and if it needs to be an array?
	case 0:                                                 // tile warp
        wtype = tmpscr[t].tilewarptype[index];
        wdmap = tmpscr[t].tilewarpdmap[index];

 //* Changed to ->Palette

 int SideWarpOverlayFlags;
 * Carryover?


//////////////////////

Screen-> ScriptEntry ScriptOccupancy and ExitScript appear to be totally
	unused; presumably intended for screen scripts that run upon entering,
	while occupying, and upon exiting a screen.

itemdata->CollectFlags references an unused variable, but it has this comment on it: A flagset that determines of the weapon can collect an item.

/////////////////
/// UNDECIDED ///
/////////////////
mapscr.valid (Screen->Valid):
	set to mVERSION in readmaps, reset_scr

In zquest.cpp draw(), draw_block(), flood(), fill_4, and a bunch of other functions, it is |='d with mVALID

So, I'd say that Screen->Valid | mVERSION is always true, and
	Screen->Valid | mVALID is true on INITIALIZED screens (i.e. screens where you have edited, which do not show as the default blank blue in ZQ)

Ah, and Screen->SideWarpIndex can be removed, as my Screen->SideWarpID[4] is array access for that var.
//! Will remove from Docs

/// TO-DO ///
/////////////

Do we have SetContinueScreen() and SetContinueDMap() under Game-> yet?
	...SetEntrancePoint() and SetContinuePoint as setters.
All size/override flags should be bool.

//to document, remove or amend
Screen-> and mapdata->
int Valid;
 * ?

 //* This seems fine? Is the ZASM incorrect? Is that what I'm reading?!

 //To ADD
 mapdata->Script (screen script)
 mapdata->InitD (screen InitD)

 all instances of the bitwise SizeFlags should become boolOverrideFlags[]

itemdata int CollectFlags;
 * Unused? Intended to be a flagset used when running a collect script, or collecting a screen item.

 //spritedata
 int Tile;
 * The tile used by the weapon sprite.

int Misc;
 * The Misc Type. (or is this Type?)

int Type;

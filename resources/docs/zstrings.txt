| STRING CONTROL CODES        |
+-----------------------------+

Enter these control codes into a message string for special formatting, effects, basic dialog
branching, or modification. (Argument values should be a number from 0 to 9999.)

In the String Editor, the "Insert SCC" button can be used to easily insert and configure these codes.

+-----------------------------+
| FORMATTING CODES            |
+-----------------------------+

\1\cset\ramp - Text Colour. Changes the following text to a certain colour. 
Argument 1 is the CSet, and argument 2 is the colour within that CSet. 
The text in the Preview Pane changes to reflect the addition and modification of this Control Code. 

\26\cset\ramp - Shadow color. Changes the color of the shadow on the text.

\27\shadow_type - Shadow type. Changes the style of the shadow on the text.

\2\newspeed - Text Speed. Changes the length of the delay between text characters appearing. 
If 0, text appears instantaneously. Argument 1 is the speed. 

\135\newfont - Text Font. Changes the font used for the text.

\25 - New Line. Equivalent to pressing Enter in a document. Best used when text wrapping is enabled.

\22 - Hero Name. Inserts the player's name into the string, replacing this SCC.
      Recommended to be used with "Text wraps around bounding box" enabled.
      The "Hero Name Preview:" field can be used to preview different names in-editor.

\28\tile\cset\width\height\flip - Draws the given tile, in the given cset, at the cursor position.
                                  Offsets text by 'width'/'height', as though it were a typed character.
                                  If width/height are >16, a tile *block* will be drawn, based on the value.

\32 through \126 - ASCII Character. Prints a character based on its ASCII code. For example, \91 allows you to display a backslash.

\24\??? - Change the portrait displaying with this message box [UNIMPLEMENTED]

+-----------------------------+
| MENU CODES                  |
+-----------------------------+

\128\tile\cset\width\height\flip - Sets the menu cursor, args same as '\28' above

\129\pos\up_pos\down_pos\left_pos\right_pos - Creates a menu cursor position.
               'pos' is the index of this position, while the 4 directional values are
			   the position that will be moved to when that direction is pressed. If a
			   directional pos is the same as 'pos', that direction will be disabled.

\130 - Start running menu. If no '\129' codes have been run, the menu instantly exits
       with the '0' pos selected.

\131\pos\newstring - Goto if menu selection. Switches to the new string if 'pos' is the
                     selected menu position.

+-----------------------------+
| SWITCH CODES                |
+-----------------------------+

    (Note: If you switch to a string that hasn't been created yet, then ZC will act as if you switched to a string with no characters in it. )

\3\register\value\newstring - Goto If Screen Variable. If one of the Screen->D[] variables of the current screen 
is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the index into the screen's D array, 
argument 2 is the value (as a LONG), and argument 3 is the string to switch to.

\23\dmap\screen\register\value\newstring - same as \3, but for a remote dmap/screen

\4\factor\newstring - Goto If Random. There is a one-in-(argument 1) chance that ZC switches to another string (argument 2). 

\5\itemID\newstring - Goto If Item. If Link has a certain item, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is 
the item ID, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\6\counter\value\newstring - Goto If Counter. If a counter is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches 
to another string. Argument 1 is the counter, argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. 

\7\counter\value\newstring - Goto If Counter %. If a counter is at or above a certain percentage of its 
maximum, then ZC switches to another string. 

\8\levelID\newstring - Goto If Triforce. If Link has acquired the Triforce from a certain level, then ZC switches to 
another string. Argument 1 is the level, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\9\quantity\newstring - Goto If Triforce Count. If Link has acquired a certain number of Triforce pieces, then ZC switches 
to another string. Argument 1 is the quantity, and argument 2 is the string to switch to.

\131\pos\newstring - Goto if menu selection. Switches to the new string if 'pos' is the selected
                     menu position.

+-----------------------------+
| COUNTER UP/DOWN CODES       |
+-----------------------------+

\10\counter\value - Counter Up. Increases a counter by a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\11\counter\value - Counter Down. Reduces a counter by a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\12\counter\value - Counter Set. Sets a counter to a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\13\counter\value - Counter Up %. Increases a counter by a certain percentage of its maximum. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage.

Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\16\itemID - Give Item. An item is silently added to Link's inventory. 
Link does not hold up the item, and the item's Pickup Script does not run - though the item's counter modifications will still take effect.

\17\itemID - Take Item. An item is removed from Link's inventory. 
The item's counter modifications will be undone when this occurs. Argument 1 is the item ID.

+-----------------------------+

\18\dmap\screen\x\y\effect\sound - Warps Link to a specific dmap, and screen, at coordinates x, y.

If x is negative, y is used for the warp return point (0 to 3; 5 for pit warp).
	Valid effects: 
		0 == none, 1 == Zap, 2 == Wave, 4 == Mosaic, 5 == Opening Wipe
	If sound arg is a valid sound effect, then ZC will play that sound during the transition.

\19\dmap\screen\register\value - Sets Screen->D[reg] for dmap, screen, to value.

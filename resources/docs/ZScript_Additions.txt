									// Syntax

////////////
// Tokens //
////////////

The ZScript parser supports the following standard and alternative tokens:

//Operational
+		:	Addition
-		: 	Subtraction
*		:	Multiplication
/		:	Division
^^^		:	Power (ex. 3 ^^^ 3 == 27)
++		: 	Increment (Pre, or Post)
--		: 	Decrement (Pre, or Post)

//Assignment
=		: 	Assign
:=		: 	Assign (alternative)
+=		: 	Add-Assign
-=		: 	Subtract-Assign
*=		: 	Multiply-Assign
/=		:	Divide-Assign

//Relational
<		:	Less-Than
>		:	Greater-Than
<=		:	Less-Than-or-Equal
>=		:	More-Than-or-Equal
==		: 	Equal
!=		:	Not-Equal
equals		: 	Equivalent to 	==
not_equal 	:	Equivalent to 	!=
~~		:	Approximately Equal
	
	
Approximately Equal
	Compares if two values are apprxiately equal within aset margin of error.
	The default margin is 0.0100
	You can set a custom margin with:
	#option APPROX_EQUAL_MARGIN <float>
	

//Logical
!		: 	Not
||		:	Logical OR
&&		:	Logical AND
^^		:	Logical XOR
and 		: 	Equivalent to 	&&
xor		: 	Equivalent to 	^^
or 		: 	Equivalent to 	||
not 		: 	Equivalent to 	!
not_eq 		:	Equivalent to 	!=
appx_eq 	:	Equivalent to 	~~
appx_equal 	:	Equivalent to 	~~

//Resolution
.		:	Script Name Scope Resolution
::		:	Namespace Scope Resolution

//Range
..		:	neither-sided range
=..		:	left-sided range
..=		:	right-sided range
=..=		:	two-sided range
...		:	two-sided range (alt)

//Bitwise
&		: 	Bitwise AND
~		: 	Bitwise NOT
|		: 	Bitwise OR
^		: 	Bitwise XOR
|=		:	Bitwise OR-Assign
&=		:	Bitwise AND-Assign
^=		:	Bitwise XOR-Assign
bitand 		: 	Equivalent to 	&
bitor 		: 	Equivalent to 	|
bitxor 		: 	Equivalent to 	^
compl		: 	Equivalent to	~
bitnot		: 	Equivalent to	~
or_eq 		: 	Equivalent to 	|=
or_equal 	: 	Equivalent to 	|=
xor_eq 		: 	Equivalent to 	^=
xor_equal 	: 	Equivalent to 	^=
and_eq 		: 	Equivalent to 	&=
and_equal 	: 	Equivalent to 	&=
~=		:	Equivalent to &= ~
bitnot_eq	:	Equivalent to &= ~
bitnot_equal	:	Equivalent to &= ~

//class
new			:	Used for function constructors
delete		:	Used for function destructors

Notes: Xor abd Logical Xor alternative Tokens
	C lacks logical xor (^^), and thus the alternate token 
	for bitwise xor (^) is 'xor', HOWEVER, all other bitwise 
	alternative tokens are prefixed with 'bit:
		e.g., 'bitand', 'bitor'
		...but the logical operator alternative tokens 
	for logical AND and logical OR (&&, ||) have no prefix:
		i.e. 'and', 'or'.
	Thus, for the sake of **linguistic uniformity**, I changed
	our alternative tokens for bitwise and logical xor.
	
	Now, logical xor (^^) uses 'xor' as an alternative token, and
	bitwise xor (^) uses 'bitxor'.
	
	WHile this differs from C, I feel that this change makes
	the alternative tokens more uniform, and easier to remember.

									// Namespaces
	
///////////////
// Namespace //
///////////////

ZScript now supports C-style namespaces.

Declaration examples:

namespace foo
{
	int x(){return 16;}
}

namespace bar
{
	int y(){return 32;}
	namespace foobar
	{
		int z(){ return 64;}
	}
}

namespace doh
{
	int xyz(){return 128;}
}

Access examples:

foo::x();
bar::y();
bar::foobar::z();


/////////////////////
// Using Namespace //
/////////////////////

You may invoke the 'using' token to bring the contents of a namespaces
into the current scope, thus ignoring the requirement for scope-resolution
(::) until the end of that scope.

You may also invoke 'using' as 'always using' to make that namespace global; this cannot be undone.

The following scopes are valid:

file
namespace
script
function

Using the above namespaces as examples:
	[example--

	//buffer
	always using namespace doh;
	//now in scope in all files, functions, and scripts
	//never falls out of scope
	//cannot be undone

	///file 1
	using namespace foo;

	//we can now ignore scope resolution for namespace foo
	x(); //now equivalent to foo::x();
	//end of file; namespace falls out of scope.

	//file 2
	using namespace bar::foobar;
	z(); //now equivalent to bar:foobar::z();
	//end of file; namespace falls out of scope.

	//function
	void main()
	{
		using namespace bar;
		y();
	} //namespace falls out of scope

	ffc script f
	{
		using namespace foo; //whole script
		void run()
		{
			using namespace bar; //only in run()
			int v = x();
			int w = y();
		}
		void n()
		{
			int r = y(); //illegal
		}
	}
	
	--end example]
	
Ambigious identifier access is an error that can occur with 'using'.
	[example--
	void foo(){}
	namespace bar
	{
		void foo(){}
	}
	
	void example()
	{
		using namespace bar;
		foo(); //Illegal; which 'foo()' are you trying to call?
	}
	--end example]
	
In this case, you can select which identifier to reference using scope resolution.
	[example--
	void example2()
	{
		using namespace bar;
		bar::foo(); //Calls 'foo()' within namespace 'bar'
		::foo(); //Calls 'foo()' that is not in a namespace
	}
	--end example]
Another example:
	[example--
	namespace bar
	{
		void foo(){}
	}
	namespace foo
	{
		using namespace bar;
		void foo(){}
		void example3()
		{
			foo(); //This is LEGAL.
		}
	}
	--end example]
	In this example, 'foo::foo()' will be called. 'using' namespaces only apply if
	there is no local match. In this case, since 'example3()' is in 'namespace foo',
	functions also in 'namespace foo' are considered local, and prioritiezed over 'using'.

/////////////////////////
// Classes and Objects //
///////////////////////// //class //object

For those familiar with C++ style programming, most of this section will be familiar.
An 'Object' is a collection of functions and variables created by constructing it
	from a 'Class' which is like a template.
Here's an example, labelled in comments:
[example--
class Rect
{
	//These are all variables.
	//Unlike script variables, *each object* gets its' OWN of all of these!
	int x,y;
	int w,h;
	int color;
	bool fill;
	
	//These are constructors. They are used with the 'new' keyword to create objects.
	Rect()
	{
		//Default some values
		w = 16;
		h = 16;
		color = 0x01;
		fill = true;
		//Values default to '0' if not set!
	}
	Rect(int tx, int ty)
	{
		Rect(); //This calls the constructor above this one to use its' code!
		//Set the object's variables to the parameters
		x = tx; y = ty;
	}
	~Rect()
	{
		//This is a destructor. It runs when the object is destroyed.
		//...there's not really much use for a destructor for a rectangle, sooo
		//just gonna trace something?
		printf("Rectangle (%d,%d) %dx%d destroyed!\n",x,y,w,h);
	}
	//This is just a normal function.
	//It can be called from the object with an '->' operator.
	void draw()
	{
		//This just draws a rectangle using the parameters of the object
		Screen->Rectangle(7,x,y,x+w-1,y+h-1,color,1,0,0,0,true,OP_OPAQUE);
	}
}
//Now we're outside the class, let's USE IT!
void some_other_func()
{
	//Construct a Rect using the basic constructor
	Rect a = new Rect();
	//Set a variable of the object
	a->color = 0x0F;
	//Use the other constructor
	Rect b = new Rect(16,0);
	b->color = 0x01;
	
	//Draw them.
	a->draw();
	b->draw();
}
//Or you can even set up loops or such.
Rect arr[176]; //global arrays of objects work fine
void generate_arr()
{
	for(int q = 0; q < 176; ++q)
	{
		Rect r = new Rect(ComboX(q),ComboY(q));
		r->color = 0xE0+((q+Div(q,16))%16);
		arr[q] = r;
	}
}
void draw_arr()
{
	//then to draw, just...
	for(int q = 0; q < 176; ++q)
		arr[q]->draw();
}
--end example]

Some misc notes:

Note that inside the class, the functions do not use an '->' of any kind to access the
variables or functions. They actually are using 'this->', but they are able to do so
automatically because they are smart. (using 'this->' manually still works).

Functions in a class may be declared as "static". This effectively removes them from objects,
making them a 'global function' in the class's name.

[example--
class foo
{
	static void print(){}
	foo()
	{
		print(); //valid, as the function is still in the class scope
		this->print(); //ERROR: function 'print' has not been declared
		foo.print(); //valid
	}
}
void testfunc()
{
	foo.print(); //Valid, even with no object to call the function from.
	foo f = new foo();
	f->print(); //ERROR: function 'print' has not been declared
}
--end example]
So, static functions can only be called either from within the class directly,
	or by using 'classname.funcname()', but NOT from an arrow.
Also noteworthy is that static functions do NOT have access to the class's 'this' pointer.
	(ALL non-static class functions, including constructor/destructor, have 'this')
The max number of objects that can exist at once is 214747, so, *a lot*.

You can also declare arrays within objects, though these behave specially.
[example--
class foo
{
	int arr[5];
	foo()
	{
		strcpy(arr,"Test"); //Works fine
		arr = 2; //Fails; 'arr' cannot be overwritten.
		arr[0] = 'B'; //Succeeds (string reads 'Best')
	}
}
--end example]
These arrays cannot be destroyed with 'DestroyArray', or owned with 'OwnArray'. They are
	always in effect "owned" by their object, and will be destroyed by the object's
	destructor. They will be saved with the object in the save file.
That said, they *have* normal array pointers, and as such can be used by basically anything
	(except the listed exceptions) that uses normal arrays.

(Any further questions about classes can be directed to @EmilyV in the development discord)
(Any ideas on better/further documentation for this are much welcome)



//////////////////////////////
// Object Memory Management //
//////////////////////////////

Pre-3.0, objects had to be manually deleted, but with ZC 3.0 there is now a garbage
collector to automate freeing objects for scripters.

TL;DR for experienced ZScript users: you don't need to use `delete` or `Free()` anymore, and
you probably never need to use `->Own` either. Read on for specifics.

The following types are objects that are tracked by the garbage collector:

* any custom user class
* bitmap
* directory
* file
* paldata
* randgen
* stack
* websocket

Note: there are other object types, but they are never explicitly created or deleted by scripts.

The ZScript garbage collector has two ways for knowing when to delete objects:

1. Reference counting - variables and arrays containing an object count as references, and
   as long as there is one reference to an object it will not be deleted
2. Reachability - objects that are not reachable from a global object, local/global variable,
   or local/global array are considered unreachable, and will be deleted. This is necessary
   to detect objects that may always have a reference count greater than zero (for example:
   two objects holding a reference to each other, but otherwise no longer in use). The process
   of detecting unreachable objects is a "full garbage collection", and only runs occasionally.

Objects made global with "GlobalObject" are never deleted by the garbage collector.

To tie an object to at least the lifetime of the currently running script, use "OwnObject".
This associates a reference to the object with the current script, so when that script ends
if there are no other references to the object it will be destroyed. Only one script may
own a particular object - subsequent calls transfer which script holds the reference.
You shouldn't need this functionality for most usages. One example of it being necessary
is if the only place you store an object is an untyped variable, which does not hold a reference.

Variables only retain a reference to an object if typed as an object. For example, using
`int` or `untyped` to store an object pointer won't count as a reference, so may result in
premature deletion. If you must store objects like that for some reason, call "OwnObject"
so its reference count is always greater than zero (as long as that script is alive), or make
it a global object.

For simple objects with no cyclical references, they are destroyed just after their last
reference is removed (as local variable going out of scope, or being overwritten, etc).

New objects have an implicit reference added to an "autorelease pool" (a construct borrowed
from Objective-C). This reference is removed the next time the script yields (such as by
calling Waitframe). If the object has not been stored somewhere by then, or made global, it
is deleted when the script yields.

For objects with cyclical references (or self-references), their deletion is deferred until
a full garbage collection run. When an object is found to be unreachable by
any global or local variables, it will be deleted. This procedure is much more expensive
than reference counting, so it doesn't run often, and when exactly it runs is subject to change.

You should not expect destructors to run at any specific time, or even at all. You should only
use destructors for debugging purposes, or for deleting/disowning other objects. Exactly when
the garbage collector runs or an object destructor is called is an implementation detail that
may change. Do NOT implement critical game functionality in destructors - doing so will result
in unpredictable behavior, and may break your quest in future versions of ZC.

Script ownership can be revoked by calling "GlobalObject()". Global objects are never deleted
by the garbage collector. You can delete a global object by making it no longer global (call
"Own" on it).

When a script terminates, objects it owns will lose a reference count, calling their
destructors immediately if their reference count is now zero.

When a quest exits, ALL non-global objects are deleted. If the quest is saved,
however, objects made global with "GlobalObject" will be *saved to the save file*,
and will still be valid on reloading the save. This includes all variables and arrays.

Currently objects in a stack do not count as a reference.

									// Datatypes

///////////////////////
/// Basic Datatypes ///
///////////////////////
The following are the current, supported BASIC datatypes in ZScript:

TYPE		LEGAL RANGE
float 		-214748.3648, 214748.3647
int		-214748, 214748
	The basic numeral datatype. Both float and int are identical.
	The different tokens exist purely for local semantics and both 
		resolve to the same type, including for the purpose of
		matching function signatures.
	The legal range depends on a compiler flag. Older versions of ZScript had
		a maximum legal range of -214747.9999, 214747.9999.
	The current version of the ZScript spec expands this to -214748.3648, 214748.3647.
	
bool	false, true
	A general boolean datatype. Internally, true is '1' and false is 0..
	Older versions of ZScript used 0.001 as 'true. The user can
		use this old value set with a compiler flag, should the user
		require it for older scripts.
	When typecasting to bool, any value that is non-zero will
		evaluate as 'true', and values of EXACTLY zero will evaluate as 'false'.
		
char32		-214748, 214748
	Similar to the C type 'char', but 32 bits wide.
	A datatype specifically for individual characters, or for strings.
	String literals are typed as char32.
	This datatype can be used to narrow function signature matching for use of
		SINGLECHAR or STRING as function inputs.
	When doing signature matches, a SINGLECHAR or a STRING LITERAL will
		match FIRST to char32.
		
		Thus:
			void foo(char32 a)
			{
				TraceS(a);
			}
			void foo(int a)
			{
				Trace(a);
			}
			
			foo("str\n"); 	//Will call: foo(char32)
			foo(16);	//Will call: foo(int);

long		-2,147,483,648 -> 2,147,483,647
	Long is a special datatype, which uses special number literals. It gives access to a long integer value,
	taking up a full 32-bits, though has no decimal portion. Bitwise operations on 'long' data will be able to hold 32 bits.
	A long value '502L' is equivalent to a float value '0.0502'.
	Long literals:
		13432423L (== 1343.2423) //Decimal long
		0xFL (== 0.0015, == 15L) //Hex long
		101010Lb (== 0.0042, == 42L) //Binary long
		00011bL (== 0.0003, == 3L) //Binary long
		17oL, 17Lo (== 0.0015, == 15L) //Octal long
		
rgb         0L -> 0xFFFFFFL
	NOTE: if compat QR "Scripts use 6-bit color (0-63) instead of 8-bit (0-255)" is enabled: 0L -> 0x3F3F3FL
	rgb is a special type used by paldata for color operations.
	rgb values cannot inherently cast to other primitive types.
	

untyped : A special datatype that can be cast to and from any other type.
	This has no distinct type of its own.
	
	Example:
		untyped ptrs[4];
		ffc f = Screen->LoadFFC(2);
		npc n = Screen->CreateNPC(16);
		lweapon l = Screen->CreateLWeapon(LW_SCRIPT);
		bitmap bitty = Game->CreateBitmap(160,240);
		
		ptrs[0] = f;
		ptrs[1] = n;
		ptrs[2] = l;
		ptrs[3] = bitty;
		
		//These now contain the raw literal value of the pointers to those objects.
		
		bool a = true;
		untyped b = a; //b == 1
		int c = b; //c == 1
	
	Note: untyped does not retain references to objects. If not careful, object pointers will be
	      deleted if only an untyped variable holds it.


///////////////////////
// Complex Datatypes //
///////////////////////

	ffc:
		Used to create a pointer to one of the 32 freeform combo objects on the current
		screen, and to access its members. You cannot create ffcs.
		The ffc datatype is the 'this' pointer for ffc scripts.
		
	npc: 
		Used to create a pointer to an npc object. 
		You may either load a current (valid) npc on the current screen to the pointer, or create
		a new npc on the screen using this pointer.
		The maximum number of npc objects is defined in std.zh, but you may have multiple pointers
		directed at a single object in memory.
		Use this to access npc varibles, arrays, and functions. 
		The npc datatype is the 'this' pointer for npc scripts.

		Used to create a pointer to a weapon object. 
		Use eweapon for enemy weapons, and lweapon for player weapons.
		You may either load a current (valid) weapon on the current screen to the pointer, or create
		a new weapon on the screen using this pointer.
		The maximum number of weapon objects (per type) is defined in std.zh, but you may have multiple pointers
		directed at a single object in memory.
		Use this to access lweapon and eweaopon varibles, arrays, and functions. 
		The eweapon datatype is the 'this' pointer for eweapon scripts.
		The lweapon datatype is the 'this' pointer for lweapon scripts.
		Note that while eweapon and lweapon share most members, that some members are unique
		to one or the other, and that these script types are not 1:1 interchangeable.
		
	itemsprite: 
		Used to create a pointer to an itemsprite object. 
		You may either load a current (valid) itemsprite on the current screen to the pointer, or create

/// Type Specifiers ///
///////////////////////

const TYPE

If you declare a type constant, one of two things occurs:
	If the ASSIGNED VALUE is also constant at compile time, then the value of the constant is converted to
	a literal during compilation.
	
	e.g.
	const int A = 5; 
	const int B = A; //A is constant at compile time
	int arr[B]; //B is sized to 5 during compilation.
	
	Such a declaration uses no stack space/registers.
	
If the type is NOT constant at compile time, the declaration is treated as a normal variable/array of its type,
	however, its value cannot be modified during runtime.
	
	e.g.
	const int hpcap = Link->MaxHP; //not constant at compile time, but the value of hpcap
		is read-only.
	const char32[]="A String"; //not constant at compile time (true const string isn't available, nor is const array).
		You cannot modify this during runtime.
	void foo(const bool a, const int b)
	{
		a = false; //illegal to write to a
		b = 64; //cannot write to b
	}
	
	This can be useful if you wish to pass params without the risk of code modifying them, especially
	when passing a pointer by reference.

This type specifier can be applied to ALL datatypes, including enum-specified types.

									// Typedef

/////////////
// Typedef //
/////////////

	You can now define your own types using typedef using normal C syntax:

	typedef old_type new_type;

	[example--
		typedef ffc object; //Allows you to declare object vars that are typed to ffc. 		

		typedef const int DEFINE;
		//Allows you to use the token DEFINE to declare constant ints. 
		
	--end example]
	
	
////////////////////
// Script Typedef //
////////////////////

	 You may also typedef script tokens, creating your own types that resolve into existing script types.

	e.g. script typedef hero villain;
	
	You may now declare the script type 'villain script', that resolves into the normal 'hero script' type.

									// Custom Datatypes	
									// Enum
//////////////////////
// Enumerated Lists //
//////////////////////

You can now define enumerated lists of constant values using the
standard C-style syntax of:

	enum { A, B, C, D = 10, E, F, G = 100, H, I = B };

	In this declaration, A == 0, B == 1, C == 2, D == 10, 
		E == 11, F == 12, G == 100, H == 101, and I == 1

By default, enums are constants of type `int`, which auto-increment by `1`.
You can change the type of the enum to a pre-existing type by using the following syntax:
	[example--
	enum = untyped
	{
		A, B, C
	};
	--end example]
If the type of an enum is set to `long`, it will auto-increment by `1L` instead of `1`.
	[example--
	enum = long
	{
		A, //0L
		B, //1L
		C  //2L
	};
	--end example]
The `@Increment` annotation can be used to manually set the increment value
	[example--
	@Increment(0.5)
	enum
	{
		A, //0
		B, //0.5
		C, //1
		D //1.5
	};
	--end example]
		
You can also define a C style enumerated list with an identifier. 
This act defines a pseudo-datatype, with assignable values limited to
the values in the enumerated list.

	enum actiontype { none, walk, attack };
	
	Now, you can declare 'actiontype' as a datatype.
	
	actiontype act;
	
	If you wish to assign a value to it, the value must be validated
	from the enumeration:
		act = walk; //Legal
		act = 7; //Error
		
	You can explicit cast values to these types to circumnavigate the
	restrictions.
		act = <actiontype>7; //this is legal. 
		
	[example--
	
		void foo(actiontype action)
		{
			actiontype newaction = action; 
		}
	
	--end example]
	You can only pass legal values in the actiontype enum to the parameter of this function.
	
	You can further declare functions to return an enum type:
	
	[example--
	
		actiontype walking()
		{
			return walk;
		}
		
	--end example]
	
	
	You can declare enums inside namespaces, and scripts, and then dereference them as any
	other namespace or script scoped component.
	
	[example--
	
		namespace myns
		{
			enum sizeflag { szNone, szSmall, szMedium, szLarge = 4 };
			enum othertype { otA, otB, otC, otD, otE, otF, otG, otH, otI, otJ };
		};
		
		myns::othertype getFlag(myns::sizeflag sz, actiontype act)
		{
			switch(act)
			{
				case none:				
				case walk:
				{
					switch(sz)
					{
						case myns::szNone: return myns::otA;  // Need to dereference the constant, as it 
						case myns::szSmall: return myns::otC; // is part of an enum, inside a namespace.
						case myns::szMedium: return myns::otD;
						case myns::szLarge: return myns::otI;
					}
				}
				case attack:
				{
					switch(sz)
					{
						case myns::szNone: return myns::otA;
						case myns::szSmall: return myns::otE;
						case myns::szMedium: return myns::otG;
						case myns::szLarge: return myns::otH;
					}
				}
				default: return myns::otA;	
			}
		}
	
	--end example]
	
	Because these count as specific types, like int, itemdata, and npc, you can use them as overloads 
	in function signatures, and as long as you always pass the enum constants, you will guarantee a match.
	
	[example--
	
		int myoverloads(int a, npc b, eweapon c);
		myns::othertype myoverloads(actiontype a, npc b, eweapon c);
		
		//If you call:
		
		myoverloads(walk, n, e);
			//This will use 'myns::othertype myoverloads(actiontype a, npc b, eweapon c)'
			
		//If you instead call:
		
		myoverloads(1, n, e);
			//This will use 'myoverloads(int a, npc b, eweapon c)'
		
	--end example]
	
	Thus, enum types allow you very precise control over function overloads.
	
	Last, you can use script-scoping, instead of namespace-scoping, if you wish:
	
	[example--
	
		ffc script foo
		{
			void run(){}
			enum fktype { seNone, seA, seB, seC };
			enum fkflag { sfNone, sfA, sfB, sfC = 4 }; 
		}
		
		int getfakestructflag(foo.fkflag flag)
		{
			int r = <int>flag; //cast to int
			return r;
		}
		
		//Convert a flag to its type ID
		foo.fktype flagtype(foo.fkflag flag)
		{
			switch(flag)
			{
				case foo.sfNone: return foo.seNone; 
				case foo.sfA: return foo.seA; 
				case foo.sfB: return foo.seB; 
				case foo.sfC: return foo.seC; 
			}
		}
	
	--end example]

									// Arrays

////////////////////////////////////
// Array Declaration Improvements //
////////////////////////////////////

	Arrays now support being declared with any constant expression.:

	[example--

		int arr[10*4]; 
		//This is now the same as int arr[40];
		
	--end example]

	Nesting array calls should now work properly. (e.g. arrA[ arrB[ arrC[ arrD[4] ] ] ] )

	Further, you may now use constants in array declarations:

	[example--

		const int sARR_MAX = 20;
		int arr[sARR_MAX];
		
	--end example]
	
//////////////////////////
// Array Reverse Access //
//////////////////////////

	Arrays now support negative indexing to access from the back.
	
	[example--
		int arr[] = {0, 3, 7, 2, 5};
		Trace(arr[-1]); //5
		Trace(arr[-2]); //2
		Trace(arr[-3]); //7
		Trace(arr[-4]); //3
		Trace(arr[-5]); //0
		Trace(arr[-6]); // Error: Out of bounds
	--end example]


/////////////////////	
// Datatype Arrays //
/////////////////////

It is legal to create an array of any legal datatype, including complex datatypes.
You may specify an explicit array size, or use an array initialiser to set its size implicitely.

Formats
TYPE IDENTIFIER[SIZE];
TYPE IDENTIFIER[SIZE] = { INITILISERS };

	SIZE may be any constant expression.

TYPE IDENTIFIER[] = { INITIALISERS };

char32 arrays may be initialised with a string:

char32 IDENTIFIER[SIZE] = "string"; //Explicit size.
char32 IDENTIFIER[] = "string"; //Sized implicitely to number of characters +1 for NULL termination.

	Explicitely-sized string arrays must be sized to at least the length + 1 to include a NULL terminator.

									// Strings

/////////////////////
// String Literals //
/////////////////////

	You may now use C-style string literals at any non-global scope.

	[example--

		TraceS("Trace this string.");
		
	--end example]


	You may use standard C-style escape characters in string literals:

	- \a\b\f\n\r\t\v for the standard values,
	- \" for quotes
	- You can escape a newline to make it not appear in the string

	Additionally, adjacent strings are merged by the compiler.

	[example--

		TraceS("This is a string"
			" on two lines");
		
	--end example]
	

///////////////////////////////////////
// Single Character Escape Sequences //
///////////////////////////////////////

You may now use escape sequences in a SINGLECHAR type:
	char32 tab = '\t';
	
	Valid Escape Characters
	\a     		Alert (Beep, Bell) (added in C89)[1]
	\b    		Backspace
	\f     		Formfeed Page Break
	\n     		Newline (Line Feed); see notes below
	\r     		Carriage Return
	\t     		Horizontal Tab
	\v     		Vertical Tab
	\\     		Backslash
	\'     		Single quotation mark
	\"     		Double quotation mark
	\?     		Question mark (used to avoid trigraphs) 
	\x0 to \xFF   	Normal ANSI characters, as hex value. 
	

	
///////////////////////////////
/// Expanded Array Literals ///
///////////////////////////////

	Array Literals of the following form may be used in lots of places,
	not just array variable declarations.

	{0, 1, 2}
	(int[]){0, 1, 2}
	(int[3]){}
	(int[3]){4}

	[example--
	
		RunFFCScript(script_no, (int[8]){arg1, arg2, arg3});
		
	--end example]
	
	If no type is specified, the array will default to 'untyped'.

///////////////////////
/// Binary Literals ///
///////////////////////

Binary numbers may be specified as '01010101b', or '0b01010101'
	(both representing '84' in this example).

//////////////////////
///  Hex Literals  ///
//////////////////////

Hexadecimal numbers may be specified, prefixed with '0x'.

Ex. 0x22 == 34
    0x4A == 74

//////////////////////
/// Octal Literals ///
//////////////////////

Similarly to hex and binary literals, you can now specify numbers using octal literals.
To specify an octal literal, the digits of the number must be 0-7, and the number must have an 'o' appended.

Ex: 17o == 15
Ex: 47o == 39

Prefixing with '0o' is a valid alternative

Ex: 0o21 ==	17

/////////////////////
/// Long Literals ///
/////////////////////

Long is a special datatype, which uses special number literals. It gives access to a long integer value,
taking up a full 32-bits, though has no decimal portion. Bitwise operations on 'long' data will be able to hold 32 bits.
A long value '502L' is equivalent to a float value '0.0502'.
Long literals:
	13432423L (== 1343.2423) //Decimal long
	0xFL (== 0.0015, == 15L) //Hex long
	101010Lb (== 0.0042, == 42L) //Binary long
	00011bL (== 0.0003, == 3L) //Binary long
	0b01011L (== 0.0011, == 11L) //Binary long
	17oL, 17Lo (== 0.0015, == 15L) //Octal long
	0o27L (== 0.0023, == 23L) //Octal long

									// New Features

/////////////////////////
// Ternary Expressions //
/////////////////////////

You may now use C-style ternary expressions:

	int x = Rand(6,8);
	int y = x > 7 ? 1 : 0;
	
	Assigns, and operations inside ternary blocks must be in parens:
		bool V = true;
		int b;
		int a = V ? ( b =  5 ) ? ( b = 4 );
		
		int c = V ? ( b -= 2 ) ? 0; 
		
		int y; int z; 
		int x = (y += 10) ? (z = 5) : (a -= 2);
		
	In all of these cases, parens are mandatory. 
	
	Further, compound ternary expressions should be placed in parens:
		int a = (V ? 1 : 0) ? 5 : 6
		
	The default, is to evaluate in a linear sequence.
			
	Thus, 
		bool ? int : int ? bool : int
	...would evaluate as: 
		bool ? int : (int ? bool : int)
	
	Using parens to define your order of operations and scope, is prudent. 


///////////////////////////
// Variable Declarations //
///////////////////////////

You can now declare, and initialise variables on one line, as in C.
	Format:
	TYPE (identifier | identifier ASSIGN NUMBER) comma [repeating] SEMICOLON
	Examples:
		int a, b, c = 9, h = 16, f = c+h;
		float n = 1.04, m = 6.03;
		
		These are equivalent to:
		int a; int b; int c = 9; int h = 16; int f = c+h;
		float n = 1.04; float m = 6.03;


///////////////////
// Explicit Cast //
///////////////////

You may now explicitly cast a value, using a type in angle braces.

	ffc f = Screen->LoadFFC(15);
	int x = <int>f;

	f = <ffc>2;


///////////////////////////
/// Arrow from Function ///
///////////////////////////

You may now use the arrow (->) operator on functions of datatypes/pointers, including
cases where you are not using the base function in an assign.
	Examples:
	int sfx = Game->LoadItemData(16)->UseSound;
	int ilvl = Game->LoadItemData(Screen->LoadLWeapon(1)->Parent)->Level;
	
	Previously, you were required to declare a variable and make an assign
		in multiple stages.#
		e.g., this: 
		int ilvl = Game->LoadItemData(Screen->LoadLWeapon(1)->Parent)->Level;
	
		...used to require:
		
		lweapon l = Screen->LoadLWeapon(1);
		itemdata id = Game->LoadItemData(l->Parent);
		int lvl = id->Level;
		
		You can now skip these useless declarations, unless you have a 
		reason or desire to cache the data in a variable. This saves stack space, 
		and, in some circumstances, may improve performance; however repeated
		use of the same variables may benefit from caching the values in a register.
		
		
////////////////////
// Comment Blocks //
////////////////////

	The ZScript language now supports C-Style comment blocks using the traditional syntax of:

	[example--

		/* 
			COMMENT BLOCK
			
		*/
		
	--end example]


/////////////////////
// Global Pointers //
/////////////////////

	You may now declare any datatype, including arrays for any datatype at a global scope.
	*	Data saved to these may become invalid and require manual cleansing by the user!
	*	Only the value of a pointer is saved, not the struct data associated with that pointer.


////////////
// Unless //
////////////

	This statement runs the code block attached to it if its statement would evaluate false
	in an if statement.
	Aside from the obvious semantical enhancement over 'if(!expression)', the advantage of 
	this, is that 'unless(expression)' is faster (in ASM instructions) than 'if(!expression)'.

	Example: 
		int x = 6; int y;
		unless(x==6)
		{
			y = 1;
		}
	
	In this example, the code block would never run, because x == 6. 
	This is the opposite of 'if', and supports 'else unless' and 'else'
	blocks following the unless statement.

//////////////////////////////////
// Declarations in Conditionals //
//////////////////////////////////

	If statements can now have a single variable declared (must be initialized) inside their conditional check.
	The variable will be accessible during the 'then' block (not the 'else' block, if present). The initial value
		of the variable is read as the condition.

	Example: 
		if(npc n = GetClosestNPC(32))
		{
			DoSomething(n->X, n->Y);
		}
		else
		{
			DoSomethingElse(); //no enemies in range
		}
	
	(For this example, assume that 'GetClosestNPC()' returns 'NULL' if no enemy is found)
	In this example, if the GetClosestNPC() function finds an enemy (i.e. does not return NULL), then
		the 'then' block will run, doing something with the enemy's position.
	If no enemy is found (the function returned NULL), then the else block will run instead.

///////////////////////
// Auto Declarations //
///////////////////////

By declaring a single variable using the type 'auto', it will inherit its
	type from its initializer.

Example:
	auto x = 5; //x is int
	auto n = Screen->LoadNPC(1); //n is npc
	auto l = Screen->CreateLWeapon(LW_FIRE); //l is lweapon
	//auto a = 1, b = 2; //ERROR: cannot use 'auto' to declare multiple variables at once
	//auto c; //ERROR: must use an initializer when using 'auto'

////////////
// Repeat //
////////////

Repeats a command a given number of times.
The value passed to repeat(const int v) must be constant at compile time.

Example:
	const int N = 10;
	int x;
	repeat(N) { ++x; }
	
This is similar to a for loop, but it produces faster ZASM, because the number
of iterations is known at compile-time.


/////////////////////
// Until, do-until //
/////////////////////

	ZScript now supports the Pascal-style token 'until'. 
	This functions as an inverted 'while' statement.
	Aside from the obvious semantical enhancement over 'while(!expression)', the advantage of 
	this, is that 'until(expression)' is faster (in ASM instructions) than 'while(!expression)'.
	
	Examples:
	
		until(x > 7) { DoSomething(); }
		
		do
		{
			Something();
		} until ( x > 7 );



/////////////////
//  Loop-Else  //
/////////////////

	You can now include an 'else' clause after any loop. The else block
	will run if the loop ends naturally, i.e. not via 'return' or 'break'.
	
	[example--
		for(int q = 1; q <= Screen->NumNPCs; ++q)
		{
			npc n = Screen->LoadNPC(q);
			if(Distance(n->X,n->Y,Hero->X,Hero->Y) < 64)
				break;
		}
		else
		{
			//No enemies are within 64 pixels of the hero
			//as the loop never hit a 'break'.
		}
	--end example]

/////////////////
//  For Loop   //
/////////////////

	The classic for loop has a couple new things. In addition to the 'Loop-Else' mentioned above,
		you can now use multiple increment statements with a comma-delimited list.
	[example--
		for(int indx = start, count = 10; count > 0; ++indx, --count)
		{
			//do something
		}
	--end example]

/////////////////
//  For-Each   //
/////////////////

	You can now iterate through each element in an array easily!
	[example--
		int arr[] = {1,10,25,3,6,2};
		for(num : arr)
			Trace(num);
		//or
		for(num in arr)
			Trace(num);
	--end example]

//////////////////////
//  'loop' keyword  //
//////////////////////

	There is a new type of loop, declared using the 'loop' keyword.
	This new loop can be used in a couple of fancy ways, and is designed
		to be optimized, and easily accomplish what you need it to.
	
	Firstly, by simply declaring `loop()`, it creates an infinite loop,
		just like a `while(true)`, but shorter to type.
	
	Secondly, you can loop through Value Ranges!
	
	[example--
		loop(q : 0=..10)
			Trace(q); //Traces 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	--end example]
	
	When looping through a value range, there are several syntax options to go over.
	
	loop(TYPE NAME IN RANGE, INCREMENT)
	
	- TYPE: You may specify the type of the variable. If it is not specified,
		it will be `const int` by default. Must also specify a NAME if type is specified.
	- NAME: You may specify the name of the variable. If it is not specified,
		it will be `__LOOP_ITER` by default.
	- IN: Either a colon (:) or the `in` keyword. This should only be present
		if the NAME was specified.
	- RANGE: Required. This is the value range to loop through.
	- INCREMENT: The amount to increment by each loop may be specified.
		If it (and the comma before it) are left out, it defaults to '1'.
		If the increment is negative, the loop will start from the high end of the range,
			and work down to the low end.
	
	Some examples:
	[example--
		loop(x in [0,100), 10)
			printf("%d\n",x); //0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90
		loop(const long x : [0,1), 100L)
			printf("%d\n",x); //0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.97, 0.98, 0.99
		loop(0=..20)
			Trace(1); //Traces '1' 20 times in a row
	--end example]
	
	The 'Loop-Else' addition listed above also applies to this new loop type.

Available annotations:
	@AlwaysRunEndpoint -
		Value: "int","long", or "float"
		Function: Causes the loop to run an extra time with an extreme value,
			preventing the iterator from overflowing the range without reaching the end.
			If given "int", will truncate to an integer value; otherwise will use
			the end of the range exactly.
		[example--
			loop(x in [0,16), 4)
				Trace(x); //0,4,8,12
			
			@AlwaysRunEndpoint("int")
			loop(x in [0,16), 4)
				Trace(x); //0,4,8,12,15 - 15 is the last integer within the range
			
			@AlwaysRunEndpoint("long") //"float" is the same
			loop(x in [0,16), 4)
				Trace(x); //0,4,8,12,15.9999 - since 16 isn't in the range, 15.9999 is the end.
		--end example]

/////////////////
// Switch-Case //
/////////////////

	ZScript now supports C-style switch statements. Case values must be numeric literals,
	ranges, or constant expressions. Each case should end in a break instruction, or else
	fallthrough can be expected to occur. You may provide a default case.

	[example-- 

		const int SOME_CONST = 11;

		switch(var)
		{
			case 1:
			{
				DoSomething(); 
				break;
			}
			case SOME_CONST:
			{
				DoSomethingElse();
				break;
			}
			case SOME_CONST+(10*2)
			{
				DoOther();
				break;
			}
			default:
			{
				DoDefault();
				break;
			}
		}

	--end example]
	
//////////////////////
// Break - Continue //
//////////////////////
	
	The 'break;' keyword will exit the current loop or switch statement it is inside.
	As of 2.55, you can supply a number to break multiple loops at once:

	[example-- 

		for(int a = 0; a < 50; ++a)
		{
			for(int b = 0; b < 50; ++b)
			{
				if(b == 3)
					break 2; //breaks out of BOTH loops
			}
		}

	--end example]
	
	The 'continue;' keyword, rather than exiting a loop, skips back to the top of it.
	'continue' ignores 'switch' statements, unlike 'break'.
	
	[example-- 

		for(int a = 0; a < 50; ++a)
		{
			for(int b = 0; b < 50; ++b)
			{
				if(b == 3)
					continue 2; //continues to the top of the 'a' loop
			}
		}

	--end example]
	
	
	 _    __      __              ____                       
	| |  / /___ _/ /_  _____     / __ \____ _____  ____ ____ 
	| | / / __ `/ / / / / _ \   / /_/ / __ `/ __ \/ __ `/ _ \
	| |/ / /_/ / / /_/ /  __/  / _, _/ /_/ / / / / /_/ /  __/
	|___/\__,_/_/\__,_/\___/  /_/ |_|\__,_/_/ /_/\__, /\___/ 
	                                            /____/       
						    
	// Value Ranges
	A Value Range represents a constant range of numbers.
	
	Several value range symbols can be used, with slightly different functions:
		A..B	- represents the numbers between A and B, NOT including A or B.
		A..=B	- represents the numbers between A and B, including B but not A.
		A=..B	- represents the numbers between A and B, including A but not B.
		A=..=B	- represents the numbers between A and B, including both A and B.
		A...B	- same as A=..=B
	
	The numbers in this range may have decimal places, and you may use constants
		as the upper and lower bounds of a range.
		
	The left value of a range must be smaller than the right:
		1=..=3
		This is a range of values >= 1.0000 and <= 3.0000
		
		3=..=1
		This is invalid and will generate an error. 
		The values being the same as each other will also generate an error.
	
	Uses:
		Value Ranges can be used in cases of switch statements. If the switch key is
			within the range, that case will execute.
	
	[example-- 
		float a = 1.5;
		const float B = 1.0;
		const float C = 2.5;
		switch(a)
		{
			case B...2.4: DoFirst(); break;
			case C...3: DoSecond(); break;
		}
	--end example]

	As the value of 'a' at this time is 1.5000, it fallswithin the range of the
	first case (B...2.4) and DoFirst() will execute.
	
	Alternatively, to set up a simple percentage roll of randomness:
	[example--
		switch(RandGen->Rand(99)) //0-99 inclusive
		{
			case 0=..10: //10% chance
				break;
			case 10=..30: //20% chance
				break;
			case 30=..60: //30% chance
				break;
			case 60=..100: //40% chance
				break;
		}
	--end example]
	One of the four outcomes will occur, with their respective chances.
	By using the left-sided range '=..', the range includes the left number,
		but not the right number.
	
	  _________ __         .__                      
	 /   _____//  |________|__| ____    ____  ______
	 \_____  \\   __\_  __ \  |/    \  / ___\/  ___/
	 /        \|  |  |  | \/  |   |  \/ /_/  >___ \ 
	/_______  /|__|  |__|  |__|___|  /\___  /____  >
	        \/                     \//_____/     \/ 
	
	You may use switch-case on STRING LITERALS.
	Note: You may use EITHER string literals, OR numeric values, but NOT BOTH.
	
	[example--
		char32 tmp[] = "Test";
		switch(tmp)
		{
			case "foo":
				DoSomething();
				break;
			case "bar":
				DoSomethingElse();
				break;
			case "Test":
				DoThirdThing();
				break;
			default:
				DoDefaultThing();
		}
	--end example]
	
	This will match the string against each literal, looking for an identical string.
	By default, this matches case-sensitively; though if the option 'STRING_SWITCH_CASE_INSENSITIVE'
		is nonzero, it will match case-insensitively.
		
	String literal switches and numeric switches cannot be mixed.
	[example--
		switch(foo)
		{
			case 1:
				DoSomething();
				break;
			case "foo":
				DoSomethingElse();
				break;
		}
	--end example]
	This code will produce a compile error, and is not allowed.
	
///////////////////
/// Logical Xor ///
///////////////////

ZScript now supports logical xor operations using the following tokens:
	^^
	logicalxor
	
	[example--
		if ( a ^^ b ) return true;
		if ( c logicalxor d ) return true;
	--end example]
	
If you chain logical xor operations, they are handled in a linear sequence
for their order of operations.
	[example--
		if ( a ^^ b ^^ c ^^ d )
		becomes
		if ( ( a ^^ b ) ^^ c ) ^^ d ) )
	--end example]
	
	It is prudent therefore, to properly specify order of operations for this operation.

////////////////////
// Exponentiation //
////////////////////

ZScript now supports Exponentiation via the '^^^' operator. Use of this operator works identically to
	calling the 'Pow()' function, except that the compiler can optimize constants at compile-time with
	the operator, which the Pow() function cannot do.

Note that '0^^^0' is defined to be '1'.

In the case that an exponentiation results in too large an output value,
	the minimum float value, '-214748.3648', will be returned.

// Longs
If either of the parameters to the '^^^' operator is of type 'long', a 'long exponentiation'
	will be performed instead. The 'LPow()' function has been added to match this behavior.

This means that '1L' will be treated as '1', meaning the full 32 bits can be used for the exponentiation,
	allowing larger calculations to be returned.
	Ex: '2L ^^^ 2L == 4L', 'LPow(0.0002, 0.0002) == 0.0004' (as 1L == 0.0001)

///////////////
// NOT Token //
///////////////

You may now use the Not (!) token on any datatype, as in C++.
Example:
	ffc f;
	if ( !f ) f = Screen->LoadFFC(3);
	
	bitmap b;
	if ( !b ) b = Game->CreateBitmap(16,16);
	else b->Create(0, 16, 16);
	
This allows checking if a pointer is initialised, easily. 


///////////////////
// Short Circuit //
///////////////////

Fixed short-circuiting. Logical AND and Logical OR now short-circuit as in C,
based on a compiler flag.

If short-circuiting is enabled, the following occurs:

	if ( a && b ) 
		//if 'a' is false, 'b' is skipped.
	if ( a || b )
		//if 'a' is true, 'b' is skipped. 


/////////////////////
// Constant Assert //
/////////////////////

You may now make constant assertions to create custom compile errors.

	[example--
		const int COMBO = 0;
		//
		CONST_ASSERT(COMBO > 0);
	--end example]
	This would cause the compile error:
		"Assert failed!"
	on the line of the assert.
	
You may also include a custom message to be printed with the error.

	[example--
		const int COMBO = 0;
		//
		CONST_ASSERT(COMBO > 0, "COMBO must be > 0!");
	--end example]
	This would cause the compile error:
		"Assert failed! COMBO must be > 0!"
	on the line of the assert.

This can be useful to prevent yourself from making mistakes, or for scripts you share
to ensure that others using your script don't make mistakes when setting constants.

/////////////////////////
//    Include Paths    //
/////////////////////////

You may now add include paths via script.
Include paths are searched when importing/including files. You can set include paths in
	'ZScript->Compiler Settings' as general configs, though now you can also add them to scripts.
	
	[example--
	//File to include is "ZC Folder/foo/foobar.zs"
	#includepath "foo"
	#include "foobar.zs"
	--end example]
	
	All '#includepath's in a file are processed before that file's imports are checked.

/////////////////////////
// Conditional Include //
/////////////////////////

You may now conditionally include a file.

	[example--
	const bool USE_TANGO = true;
	
	#includeif(USE_TANGO, "tango.zh")
	--end example]
	
If the constant expression evaluates to true, the file will be imported.
Otherwise, it will be skipped.

//////////////////////
// Include Checking //
//////////////////////

You may now check if a file is included.

	[example--
	if(IS_INCLUDED("tango.zh"))
	{
		//Show a tango message
	}
	else Screen->Message(5);
	--end example]

This is considered a constant expression.

///////////////////////////
//  Function Prototypes  //
///////////////////////////

You may now declare a 'function prototype', which can (but does not have to) be defined later.
	[example--
	
	int foo(int x, int y);
	
	--end example]

This prototype has no body, unless you later declare the function in full.
	[example--
	
	int bar();
	
	//Later, even in another file
	
	int bar()
	{
		Trace(10);
		return 5;
	}
	
	--end example]

If the function is declared later, then that is what runs; the prototype is effectively ignored.
If the function is NOT declared later, then calls to the prototype will *still compile*, though the prototype will do
	nothing, aside from `return NULL;`.
	
You may also specify the default return value, so it will return a value other than 0!
	[example--
	
	int foo() : default 7;
	
	--end example]
If the function is never fully declared later, then this would simply `return 7;`.
The value used for this default can be any constant expression, so the following are all valid:
	[example--
	
	const int A = 5;
	int foo() : default A;
	
	int bar() : default 5 * 7;
	
	int foobar() : default (IS_INCLUDED("tango.zh") ? 10 : 2);
	
	--end example]

Do note that the type of the default value must match the return type. The default return, 'NULL', is 'untyped', and
	will work for any type.
	
	[example--
	
	ffc foo() : default <ffc>1; //correct
	ffc foo() : default 1; //Type cast error
	ffc foo(); //Returns a null pointer
	ffc foo() : default NULL; //Same as above
	
	void foo() : default 1; //Type cast error
	void foo(); //correct
	--end example]

////////////////////////////////
//  Function Optional Params  //
////////////////////////////////

You may now have optional parameters in functions.
	[example--
	void foo(int x = 25)
	{
		Trace(x*2);
	}
	foo(); //Traces '50'
	foo(10); //Traces '20'
	--end example]

Optional parameters cannot have any non-optional parameters listed after them.
The default value for an optional parameter must be compile-time constant.

////////////////////////////////
//  Function Variadic Params  //
////////////////////////////////

For any function which does NOT use optional paramters, you may instead
	use variadic parameters.
	[example--
	int sum(...int[] args)
	{
		int sum = 0;
		for(x : args)
			sum += x;
		return sum;
	}
	Trace(sum(1,2,3)); //traces 6
	Trace(sum(5,20,3,2)); //traces 30
	--end example]

The variadic parameter can take any number of matching paramters, and stuffs
	them into an array for you. A size 0 array is possible if none are passed.

/////////////////////////////
//  Function Declarations  //
/////////////////////////////
	
You can now declare functions in remote scopes.
	[example--
	
	ffc script foo{}
	//
	void foo.run(int x)
	{
		Trace(x);
	}
	--end example]
This is especially useful with function prototypes!
	[example--
	
	ffc script foo
	{
		void run()
		{
			Trace(bar());
		}
		int bar();
	}
	//Another file
	int foo.bar()
	{
		return 10;
	}
	--end example]

									// Bugfixes
	
///////////////////////
// Constant Division //
///////////////////////

Fixed a bug where division of a constant would result in truncation that did not occur in 2.50.x
Fixed issues with division by an integer, where values would be truncated.
Added #option TRUNCATE_DIVISION_BY_LITERAL_BUG as a compiler flag to enable the old, 2.50.x behaviour
Fixed scope resolution for identifiers and variables when used across
	imported files.
	Example:

		//buffer

		import "bar.zs"
		void foo()
		{
			scrid.bar();
		}
		////////////////////end of buffer
		
		//bar.zs
		
		ffc script scrid
		{
			void run(){}
			voud bar(){ Trace(1); }
		}
	
	This worked in 2.50.x, but broke at some point in 2.55, and the
	correct behaviour has been restored. 
		
Script errors will now give line and column references prior to the
	error type.
		
	Old:
		Error S007: Variable X can't have type VOID.
			@ LINE 4 COLUMNS 1-11
		
	New: 
		LINE 4 @ COLUMNS 1-11 - ERROR S007: Variable X can't have type VOID.
Syntax errors have yet to be updated.
		
Fixed some issues where compiler errors improperly carried over. 

Fixed import directive pathing with backslashes:
	Importing in zscript with a path such as scripts\scriptfile.z used to work, in prior versions. 
	As of 2.55, it reads \ as an escape character, and parses the file path improperly. 
	This has now been corrected, so that you may use / or \ as a valid path token, however, / is the better option.


//////////////
// Waitdraw //
//////////////

The Waitdraw() instruction defers further execution of a script (pausing it) until 
	draws to the screen have been rendered for the present frame.
	
The following script types now support Waitdraw():
ffc, screendata, eweapon, itemsprite, itemdata.
You may disable Waitdraw support (for compatibility reasons) for ffc scripts, 
	and itemdata scripts in the ZScript Quest Settings Dialogue.
	
Waitdraw support for npc, and lweapon scripts remains t/b/a.

* FFC Scripts are the absolute, pure origin og ZScript. Originally called FFScript, and designed 
* to be attached to 'FreeForm Combos' in ZQuest 2.11, FFC scripts still serve this subtle, yet powerful
* purpose to this day.

* The 'this' pointer for ffc scripts is ffc (ri->ffcref).
* You can assign this script type to each of the 32 ffcs on every mapscreen via the menus
* 	Screen>>>Edit FFC>>Script (tab).
*
* In order to run its script, not only must you set the script ID, but the FFC MUST use a combo ID
*	greater than zero. Combo ID 0 cannot run scripts initially, although an already-running
* 	ffc script can write this->Data = 0without the script exiting,
*
* FFC scripts can run for multiple frames, and in addition to the eight standard D[] registers,
*	they have two A[] (address) registers, however the use of A registers is exclusive to ZASM
*	(assembly code) scripts, and there is no benefit to using them in the ZScript C++ style
*	language.
*
*	The purpose of these A registers is to allow ASM-level access to the D-registers of other FFC 
*		scripts running on the same screen.
* In past versions of ZQuest, FFC scripts did not have support for the Waitdraw instruction.
* As of 2.55, Alpha 26, FFCs can use Waitdraw() properly.
* A QR governs this capability: Legacy quests will disable FFC Waitdraw support on quest loading
* 	in ZC Player, and when you load the old quest into the ZQ Editor,
(	New quests created in 2.55 have Waitdraw() support enabled by default.
*	You may enable Waitdraw support in legacy quests by toggling the ZScript setting:'No FFC Waitdraw'.
*	When this setting is enabled, FFC scripts that call Waitdraw() behave as 2.11->2.53 FFC scripts 
* 		that call Waitdraw().

* Global scripts run without context to a specific pointer or datatype.
* There are six, fixed slota; of which you may directly assign scripts
* to five. 
* 
* Slot assignment during compilation to the ~Init Slot (1) is automatic.
* 
* Global scripts do not have InitD args, and parameters listed within the 
* braces of the normal run(...) function are initialised to NULL (0).
* 
* Global scripts are executed automatically when their conditions are valid, 
* based on the script slot to which the user assigns them.

//////////////////////////
// Slot (1) : Game Init //
//////////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: '~Init'
*
* 	This script runs FOR ONE FRAME, on the first play of a quest.
* 	It is used to initialise global arrays, and the user can create additional
* 	context for it by creating a script named 'global script Init'. 
* 	
* 	During post-compilation slot assignment, any global script with the
* 	EXACT IDENTIFIER 'Init' will be assigned to this slot.
* 
* 	Manual slot assignment to ~Init is possible for ASM script imports,
* 	but doing this may have unintended side-effects.
* 	
* 	Any instructions within the body of the run() function of the script
* 	will execute during game initialisation, but only if the player has not
* 	saved the game.

///////////////////////
// Slot (2) : Active //
///////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'Active'
*
* 	This script can run for multiple frames, and runs during the normal action of the game.
* 	
* 	The typical purpose of this script slot is to tailor the game engine to your needs, and 
* 	the body of its run() function serves as the ZScript equivalent to a main() loop in C.
* 
* 	Generally, the body of this script is an infinite loop, ending in a Waitframe(), although
* 	it may consist of a conditional loop or series of loops, each with instructions to process
* 	during different stages of your game.
* 
* 	Normally, if the player is still playing the quest, then this script is running:
* 		It automatically terminates if you issue a Quit() instruction, if it runs out of scope, 
* 		or under one of the following conditions:
* 	
* 		The player HP falls below '1'. 
* 			Under this circumstance, the script runs for ONE additional frame to allow
* 			your scripts to restore the player HP.
* 			Failing to revive the player will exit this script, and the Hero Scrit Death Slot
* 				will run, followed by the Global Exit Slot (3).
* 				!!VERIFY TIMING
* 		The player triggers the F6 menu.
* 		Any script calls Game->Continue(), or Game->End().
* 
* 	The global active script can run for multiple frames, and supports the Waitdraw() command.

//////////////////////////
// Slot (3) : Game Exit //
//////////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'onExit'
*
* 	This script runs FOR ONE FRAME, after the player dies, or otherwise after the 
* 	game action ends via calling the game over menu.
* 
* 	The purpose of this script slot is to modify global variables or array values prior to 
* 	writing the game save, such as the number of times the polayer has saved his adventure.

///////////////////////////////
// Slot (4) : Load from Save //
///////////////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'onSaveLoad'
*
* 	This script runs FOR ONE FRAME, on every load of a quest from the file select 
* 	screen, AFTER the player has saved the game at least one time.
* 
* 	This script does not run when continuing a game with F6>>>Contunue from the game over
* 	menu, nor when continuing a game with the Game->Continue() ZScript command.
* 
* 	The purpose of this script slot is to reinitialise any user-created conditions, such as re-init
* 	of user bitmaps, re-priming global pointers, or otherwie ensuring that your global or internal
* 	values are correct before the game resumes from a file where values to these variables / pointers
* 	may now be stale, but were saved to the .sav file.

//////////////////////////
// Slot (5) Game Launch //
//////////////////////////

* 	SLOT NAME: 'onLaunch'
*
* 	This script slot runs for MULTIPLE FRAMES, on every load of a quest from the file select 
* 	screen, whether the quest has been previously played, or not. 
* 
* 	This script does not run when continuing a game with F6>>>Contunue from the game over
* 	menu, nor when continuing a game with the Game->Continue() ZScript command.
* 
*	It is similar to slots (1) and (4), and can take the place of either, unless you have timing-specific 
* 	issues that require two scripts to execute.
* 
* 	This script runs after global slot (1) and after Hero script slot (1) on a virgin save slot, 
* 	or directly after global slot (4) if the game has previously been saved.
* 
* 	The purpose of this script slot is to reinitialise any user-created conditions, such as re-init
* 	of user bitmaps, re-priming global pointers, or otherwise ensuring that your global or internal
* 	values are correct before the game resumes from a file where values to these variables / pointers
* 	may now be stale, but were saved to the .sav file.
*
*	This script will run until either you exit the game via a command such as 'Game->End()', or you exit the script.
*	Exiting the script without invoking a command such as 'Game->End()' will proceed to the opening wipe.

/////////////////////////////////////////
// Slot (6) :  Continue Game from Menu //
/////////////////////////////////////////

*	 SLOT NAME: 'onContGame'
*
*	 This script runs FOR ONE FRAME, when the user resumes/reloads an already-running
*	 game either via F6>>>Contunue, or Game->ShowContinueScreen(), from the game over menu, 
*	 or by continuing a game with the Game->Continue() and similar ZScript commands.
* 
*	 This script does not run when loading a game from the file select screen.
* 
*	 The purpose of this script slot is similar to that of slots (2), (4) and (5), but it may also 
*	 be useful in setting minor conditions, such as the player health/magic.
* 
*	 This script slot runs prior to the opening wipe.

/////////////////////
// Slot (7) : Menu //
/////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'onF6Menu'
*
*	This script runs for multiple frames, whenever the player presses F6 or selects the system menu option
*	'Game>>End Game' to display the save screen menu, or runs the 'Game->ShowContinueScreen()' ZScript command,
*	(but not when the player dies; see Hero Slot (3) 'onDeath' for that application.)
*
*	If the compatibility rule 'Old (Instant) F6 Menu' in 'Quest->Rules->Backwards Compatibility' is enabled,
*	this script slot will never be executed.
*
*	The purpose of this script slot is to permit making a drop-in, scripted  replacement for the standard 
*	Continue/Save/Retry menu screen.
*
*	During the execution of this script, all script draws will occur above a static image of the screen as it was
*	before the script began. All engine action, save for this script, and input polling, will be suspended for the duration
*	of the script.
*
*	This script will run until either you exit the game via a command such as 'Game->End()', or you exit the script.
*	Exiting the script without invoking a command such as 'Game->End()' will then open the standard system F6 menu,
*	unless the quest rule 'Skip Continue Screen' in 'Quest->Rules->Other' is active. If the player does not chooses
*	to exit via the standard continue screen, or it is skipped via the aforementioned rule, gameplay will resume
*	exactly where it left off.

//////////////////////
// Slot (8) :  Save //
//////////////////////

*	 SLOT NAME: 'onSave'
*
*	 This script runs FOR ONE FRAME, when the game saves the save data.
*	 This occurs either from F6>>>Save (or GameOver>>>Save), when saving via a Save Point combo type,
*	 as well as from the ZScript commands 'Game->Save()', 'Game->SaveAndQuit()', and 'Game->SaveAndContinue()'.
*	 
*	 This runs AFTER the 'onExit' script, in any condition that would cause both to run.
*	 
*	 The main purpose of this script is to allow saving of custom script data that would NOT be saved to the
*	 save file; such as ZScript files, bitmap images, or SRAM.

* When you compile this script type, you can assign it to one of the following slots,
* 	which determines when it runs, and how often it runs.
* Hero scripts are executed automatically when their conditions are valid, 
* 	based on the script slot to which the user assigns them.

/////////////////////
// Slot (1) : Init //
/////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'Init'
*
* 	This script runs FOR ONE FRAME at the start whenever the player sprite is initialised, 
*	both at the start of a game, and via F6>>>Continue (or Game->Continue()).
*	
*	It allows you to set up initial values for the player, BEFORE the opening wipe, such as his 
*	Invisibility state, or his screen position.
* 	You can give the player  equipment, and other effects at this time.
*
*	These effects take place BEFORE the engine writes to Screen->EntryX, and Screen->EntryY, 
*	so if you give the player sprite custom starting coordinates by script, reading those values 
*	from the Screen pointer, should give you accurate data.
*

///////////////////////
// Slot (2) : Active //
///////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'Active'
*
*	This script slot runs after (1), and also after the global script (2; active).
*
* 	This script can run for multiple frames, and runs during the normal action of the game.
* 	
* 	The typical purpose of this script slot is to control the player sprite in ways that 
*	extend beyond the normal internal engine mechanics, such as scaling the sprite with the
* 	Z-Axis of the player, or using scripted tiles and animations for diagonal walking.
*
* 	Generally, the body of this script is an infinite loop, ending in a Waitframe(), although
* 	it may consist of a conditional loop or series of loops, each with instructions to process
* 	during different stages of your game.

*	This script can run for multiple frames, until either it runs out of, scope, 
*	you call Quit() inside the script body, or the player presses F6 to open the standard
*	SAVE/CONTINUE/RETRY menu.
*
* 	You may use Waitdraw() in this script type. 
*	
*	If Hero dies, this script halts, and hero script (3), 'onDeath' runs.
*	If Hero wins the game, this script halts, and hero script (4), 'onWin' runs.
*

//////////////////////
// Slot (3) : Death //
//////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'onDeath'
*
*	This script runs when Hero DIES. 
*	It runs BEFORE the GLOBAL EXIT script, and after Hero is DEAD, with no chance of revival.
*		^ If you need to revive the player, such as with a Faerie in a Bottle, use the
*		^ Hero Active script slot for that effect.
*	The script will run before the engine's death animation, unless the quest rule
*	'Hero OnDeath script runs AFTER engine death animation' under 'ZScript->Quest Script Settings' is selected, in which case
*	it will run immediately following this animation.
*
*	This script can run for multiple frames, and is intended to permit you to construct your
*	own Game Over sequences.
*
*	During the execution of this script, all script draws will occur above a static image of the screen as it was
*	before the script began. All engine action, save for this script, and input polling, will be suspended for the duration
*	of the script.
*
*	This script will run until either you exit the game via a command such as 'Game->End()', or you exit the script.
*	Exiting the script without invoking a command such as 'Game->End()' will continue the player's death where it left off.
*	If the script is set to run prior to the engine death animation, exiting via a command such as 'Game->End()' will
*	skip the engine's death animation.

///////////////////////
// Slot (4) : Ending //
///////////////////////

*	SLOT NAME: 'onWin'
*
*	This script runs if the player WINS THE GAME (e.g. via Combo Flag 15).
*	It can run for more than one frame, and it is intended to permit you to make your own
*	Game Ending scenes, or credits scroll.
*
*	You can disable the internal credits scroll, or you can permit that to run normally,
*	after your own credits sequence via the command Game->SkipCredits.

POINTER: 		genericdata
InitD:			(Not *yet*)
InitD Labels:	No
Multiple Frames:	Yes
Waitdraw Support:	Special

A generic script can be run in multiple different ways.

Firstly, it can run 'passively':
	Once a generic script starts running passively, there are 39 different timings throughout each
		frame that they can run. They will first run at the first available timing after being
		launched; after 'Waitframe()', they return to the "Start of Frame" timing.
	The 'WaitTo' function can be used to go to each specific timing, similarly to how
		'Waitdraw' works in other scripts.
	The 'WaitEvent' function can be used to handle specific events.
	The passive running of a generic script is also affected by it's 'ExitState' and 'ReloadState'
		arrays, which can exit the script or restart it from the beginning when certain conditions
		are met (such as changing screens/dmaps, continuing, reloading, ...)

Secondly, it can run 'frozen':
	A 'frozen' run works similar to the dmapdata 'ActiveSubscreen' slot, or global onF6 or onLaunch.
	The script will run frame after frame, with NO other part of the engine running (aside from
		combo animation, which will run unless 'Game->Suspend[]' is used) until the script
		reaches end-of-scope or exits.
	While running frozen, a still image of the screen before the script started will be
		drawn to layer 0 each frame; nothing else other than script draws is drawn.
	A generic script is run frozen using the 'genericdata->RunFrozen()' function.

The new directive, #include, checks include paths first, then absolute, then relative to the ZQ binaries. 

///////////////////////////
// Compiler Option Flags //
///////////////////////////

There are now compiler flags that you may enable, or disable, to

To use these, call the #option directive, followed by the flag macro, and (on | off | error | warn | inherit | default).
	#option LOGGING off
	
	Flag types:
		on : This enables the option.
		off: This disables the option.
		error: Used for certain options.
		warn: Used for certain options.
		inherit: This causes the option to inherit from its last state (e.g., from an importing file). 
		default: Use the default ZQuest value for this option. (Set in 'ZScript->Compiler Settings')
	
	MACROS
	
	NO_LOGGING
		Off by default.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If set 'on', then all calls to Trace() type functions will be ignored. 
	
	TRUNCATE_DIVISION_BY_LITERAL_BUG
		Off by default, however on by default for quests made prior to 2.55.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		Enable this to force scripts to comply to the 2.50.x
			bug, where division by a literal resulted in truncation.
		
	SHORT_CIRCUIT
		On by default, however off by default for quests made prior to 2.55.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		Enable short-circuiting; see section 'Short Circuiting' above
		
	BOOL_TRUE_RETURN_DECIMAL
		Off by default, however on by default for quests made prior to 2.55.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If on, the boolean value 'true' will be represented as '0.0001' instead of '1'.
			This may be necessary for compatibility with some scripts.
		
	NO_ERROR_HALT
		Off by default.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If on, compilation will continue even when a compiler error has been thrown.
			The script will still fail to compile, though it will issue all reachable errors before failing, instead of only the first one it encounters.
		If off, compilation will halt on the first encountered error, as in previous versions.
		
	TRUE_INT_SIZE
		On by default, however off by default for quests made prior to 2.55.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If on, the range of int/float constants will be expanded to '-214748,214748' and '-214748.3648,214748.3647' respectively.
		If off, the range will remain '-214747,214747' and '-214747.9999,214747.9999', as in previous versions.
		
	FORCE_INLINE
		Currently unused, pending full implementation of 'inline'
		
	BINARY_32BIT
		Off by default.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If on, binary operations and literals will use the true 32-bit values of a number, rather than the ZScript values.
			This means that '1b' == '0.0001' instead of '1'.
			This allows 32 separate bits to be used, which can be usedful for flagsets.
		If off, binary will behave as it did previously.
		This option is FORCED to 'off' for 'std.zh', as it would break a number of functions.
		Be cautious when using this option.
		
	APPROX_EQUAL_MARGIN <float>
		Sets the margin of error for the ~~ (approximately equal) operator.
		The defailt margin of error is 0.0100, so (1.090 ~~ 1.080) == true.
		Set to a foating point value to use a new error margin for ~~.
	
	STRING_SWITCH_CASE_INSENSITIVE
		Off by default.
		Valid values: 'on', 'off', 'inherit', 'default'
		If on, switch-case on string literals will be case-insensitive.
		Else, they will be case-sensitive.
	
	WARN_DEPRECATED
		Off by default.
		Valid values: 'on'/'warn', 'off', 'error', 'inherit', 'default'
		On using a deprecated internal function/variable, a compile
			warning will be thrown.
		If 'off', this is disabled.
		If 'error', a compile error will be thrown instead of a warning.
		
Files default to inheriting the option state of the file that imported them. For the buffer, this will use the defaults.
You may force an option to its' default value by setting it to 'default'
The default values can be modified in ZQuest, under 'ZScript->Compiler Settings'.

Note: 	You can use any constant expression, or constant value that is one to represent 'on',
	and any constant expression, or constant value that is zero to represent 'off'.
	For options which only take 'on' or 'off', any other value is treated as 'on'.
	You can use any constant expression, or constant value that is two to represent 'error',
	and any constant expression, or constant value that is three to represent 'warn'.
	The options 'inherit', and 'default' are specific, and not bound to any literal value. 
	Thus, you cannot create macros for them, or otherwise trigger them with constant expressions.

/////////////////////////////
//       Annotations       //
/////////////////////////////

Annotations allow for metadata to be set in specific circumstances.

An annotation is specified as follows:
	@Key("Value")
Annotations can be listed together to use multiple on the same target, as follows:
	@Key("Value"), @Key2("Value2")

Annotations can be attached to various script elements, and will be listed where appropriate.

//////////////////////////////
//    Script Annotations    //
//////////////////////////////

The following annotations can be attached to any `script`

	[example--
		
		@Author("EmilyV") //This sets the 'Author' metadata of 'script foo' to read 'EmilyV'
		ffc script foo
		{
			void run()
			{
				TraceS("Test");
			}
		}
		
	--end example]

Available annotations:

	@Author -
		Function: Sets the author name metadata field
		Value: String (limit 255 chars)
	
	@Attribute0 - @Attribute9
	@Flag0 - @Flag15
		Function: Sets attribute metadata for the script.

		Default value: void run() parameter name
	
	@InitDHelp0 - @InitDHelp7
		Function: Set InitD help text.
		Editor effect: Combo, FFC, Item, LWeapon scripts
		Value: String (limit 65535 chars)
	
	@InitDType0 - @InitDType7
		Function: Set InitD field type.
		Editor effect: Combo, FFC, Item, LWeapon scripts
		Value: "D","H","LD","LH","B", or "-1"
		Default value: Based on void run() parameter type-
			int, float, untyped: "D"
			long: "LD"
			bool: "B"
			otherwise: "-1"
	
	@InitScript
		Valid on: Global Scripts
		Function: Mark the script to be merged into the global ~Init slot
		Value: Number, a weight used to determine merge order.
		       (the 'global script Init' has a weight of 0)
		Default value: Unset. Setting this to ANYTHING stops the default
		               behavior, and marks the script to be merged.

//////////////////////////////////
/// Mechanical and AST Changes ///
//////////////////////////////////

	Assignment is now an expression instead of a statement. You can theoretically assign 
	inside of a statement now.
	
	[example--
		
		ffc script foo
		{
			void run()
			{
				int x = 0;
				while( (x+=2) < 20 ) Waitframe();
			}
		}
		
	--end example]

	Constants are now treated as normal (unassignable) variables up through type checking. 
	If at that point the constant's value is known, it is stripped out of the AST and its 
	value is saved to the symbol table, similar to how it worked before.

	If the constant's value is not known at compile time, it is instead treated as a normal, 
	unassignable variable by the parser. (It still uses no stack space.)
		In this case, the value is still not considered compile-time constant, and thus cannot
		be used in statements such as 'repeat' and 'case'.

	Constants can now be declared in any scope, not just global scope, and the constant is only
	valid within its scope, so you may now have constants on a per-script, or per-scope basis. 
	
	[example--
	
		ffc script foo
		{
			void run()
			{
				const int X = 10;
				int a = X;
			}
		}
	
	--end example]
	
	You may assign a value to a constant using any constant expression.
	
	[example--
	
		const int A = 5;
		const int B = 10;
		const int C = A*(Pow(B,2));
	
	--end example]

constexpr float DegtoRad(float degrees);
constexpr float DegToRad(float degrees);
 * Converts Degrees to Radians. More accurate than the old std_functions DegtoRad.
 * Because radians are mostly decimal and zscript can only have 4 decimals, there is very minor inaccuracies
 * with this conversion that are not feasibly fixable; however, it is still more accurate than the old std.zh conversion function,
 * where the old conversion could potentially be 2 entire degrees off at certain angles, while this version only loses about 0.0004 degrees of accuracy.
 * In addition, casting between DegtoRad and RadtoDeg repeatedly will *not* lose additional precision with each call; only the first call will lose precision.

 * the max index of 'src' is unaffected.
 * If 'dest' is smaller than 'src', then data is copied until
 * 'dest' is full, and verflow is ignored (harmless), but there is

 *     "%i" - Integer. Inserts the number as a string, without decimal places.
 *     "%f" - Float. Inserts the number as a string, with decimal places.
 *     "%l" - Long. Inserts the number as a string, in 'long' integer format.

 *                 with a min digits of 8.
 *     "%%" - Inserts a single '%' character, without trying to read it as an argument.
 *     "%" followed by anything other than the above is considered an error. This should never be done.
 * Flags can be used between the '%' and the letter.
 *     "%0#L", where '#' is a number, and 'L' is any letter from 'ifdpxXbB' (numeric points)
 *           - Requires that the integer portion of the number be at least '#' digits long.
 *             This will fill up to the specified length with '0' characters.
 *             The max number allowed is 10 (ex. "%010d").
 *             For 'b' and 'B', the max is 32 (ex. "%032B").
 *           Ex. "%02d" given the argument '1' will print '01'.
 *               "%02d" given the argument '11' will print '11'.
 * The resulting string will be placed in the buffer, which will be resized if it is
 *     too small to hold the output.

void printf(char32 format[], ...untyped...);

void printfa(char32 format[], untyped[] args);
 * Same as 'printf', but takes an array of args instead of multiple args.
void sprintfa(char32[] buf, char32 format[], untyped[] args);
 * Same as 'sprintf', but takes an array of args instead of multiple args.

 * Takes 2 or more arguments, and returns the highest value between them.
T Choose(T first, ...T);
 * Takes 1 or more arguments, and returns a random argument.

* Overlay one tile onto another.

int SizeOfArray(T[] arr);
 * Returns the size of an array (any type)

T ArrayPopBack(T[] arr);
T ArrayPopFront(T[] arr);
T ArrayPopAt(T[] arr, int indx);
 * Decreases the size of the array by 1, removing and returning a value.

bool IsValidArray(untyped[] arr);
 * Returns true if the passed array pointer is valid (usable), false if it is invalid (should not be used).

 *
 * Writing to files does not write directly to disk, but to a buffer.
 *     It is guaranteed that the contents of this buffer will be written to disk
 *     upon a successful call to 'Flush()', or upon the closing of the file.
 *     Upon exiting the quest, all open files are closed.
 *
 * There is a limit of 256 file pointers. A pointer does not need to have a file
 *     open to count against this limit. Any pointer that returns true from
 *     'isAllocated()' counts against this limit. As long as you don't hold references

 *            and the file is treated as a new empty file.
 *     "a"  | append: Open file for output at the end of a file. Output operations
 *            always write data at the end of the file, expanding it. Repositioning
 *            operations ('Seek()', 'Rewind()') are ignored. The file is created if
 *            it does not exist.
 *     "r+" | read/update: Open a file for update (both for input and output). The
 *            file must exist.

 *     "a+" | append/update: Open a file for update (both for input and output)

 *
 * The letter "b" can be added to the end of any of these (or before the "+", for update modes)

 * Text files are files containing sequences of lines of text. Depending on the environment
 *     where the application runs, some special character conversion may occur in input/output
 *     operations in text mode to adapt them to a system-specific text file format. Although
 *     on some environments no conversions occur and both text files and binary files are
 *     treated the same way, using the appropriate mode improves portability.

void Close();
 * Closes any open file connected to the file pointer.
 * This does NOT deallocate the pointer; it is still free to open new files on.

void Free();
 * DEPRECATED: This no longer does anything - objects are freed automatically now.
 *             See "Object Memory Management" section
 * Closes any open file connected to the file pointer.
 * This will deallocate the file pointer, so that the pointer ID may be re-used.
 * There is a limit to how many file pointers may be allocated at once.
 * See the 'General Information' at the top of this section for more details.

void Own();
 * Grants 'Ownership' of the pointer to the currently running script.
 * [pre-3.0] When the script terminates (at the same time any Local Arrays in the script
 *     are cleared), the pointer will be automatically freed.
 * See "Object Memory Management" section

bool isAllocated();
 * Returns true if this file pointer is allocated.
 * This does NOT mean it has a file open; the pointer simply has an ID.

bool isValid();
 * Returns true if this file pointer has a file open.

bool Allocate();
 * Attempts to allocate the file pointer. If it was already allocated, this will re-allocate it;
 *     without deallocating the old pointer! This should not be called on already allocated pointers.
 * Returns true if it can allocate; false otherwise. A false return indicates that the maximum
 *     number of allocated files has been reached.

bool Flush();
 * Flushes the buffer of the file being written to.
 * Writes to a file do not actually write to the file immediately; they instead go to a buffer.
 *     Calling this function will force the buffer to be written to disk.

int ReadString(char32[] buf);
 * Reads a section of characters from the file.
 * Will read either until 'buf' is full, an error occurs, End of File is reached, or a newline
 *     character is reached.
 * If it ends due to reaching a newline character, the newline character will be included at the
 *     end of the string.
 * Returns the length of the string read into 'buf'.

int ReadChars(char32[] buf, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Reads a section of characters from the file.
 * Starts placing characters at 'buf[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'buf[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, reads until it fills 'buf', an error occurs, or End of File is reached.
 * If 'count' is positive, reads 'count' characters into 'buf'.
 * Will always add a null character at the end of the read characters.
 * Returns the number of characters read, excluding the added null character.
 
int ReadBytes(untyped[] buf, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Reads a section of binary data from the file.
 * Starts placing data at 'buf[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'buf[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, reads until it fills 'buf', an error occurs, or End of File is reached.
 * If 'count' is positive, reads 'count' characters into 'buf'.
 * The binary data read will be 8b; such that reading '1' will place '1' into buf.
 *     This means that the binary data cannot contain decimal places.
 * Returns the number of bytes read.

int ReadInts(untyped[] buf, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Reads a section of binary data from the file.
 * Starts placing data at 'buf[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'buf[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, reads until it fills 'buf', an error occurs, or End of File is reached.
 * If 'count' is positive, reads 'count' characters into 'buf'.
 * The binary data read will be 32b; such that reading '1' will place '0.0001' into buf.
 *     This means that the binary data can contain decimal places.
 * Returns the number of ints read.

int WriteString(char32[] str);
 * Writes the string stored in 'str' to the file.
 * Returns the number of characters successfully written.

int WriteChars(char32[] buf, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Writes characters from 'buf' to file.
 * Starts at 'buf[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'buf[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, writes from 'buf' until it finds a null character, or reaches the end of 'buf'.
 * If 'count' is positive, writes 'count' characters from buf.
 * Returns the number of characters successfully written.
 
int WriteBytes(untyped[] arr, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Writes 8b binary data from 'arr' to file.
 * The binary data written will be 8b; such that writing '1' will write '1' to file.
 *     This means that the binary data cannot contain decimal places.
 * Starts at 'arr[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'arr[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, writes from 'arr' until it reaches the end of 'arr'.
 * If 'count' is positive, writes 'count' ints from arr.
 * Returns the number of bytes successfully written.

int WriteInts(untyped[] arr, int count = -1, int pos = 0);
 * Writes 32b binary data from 'arr' to file.
 * The binary data written will be 32b; such that writing '1' will write '10000' to file.
 *     This means that the binary data can contain decimal places; writing '0.0001' will write '1' to file.
 * Starts at 'arr[pos]'.
 *     If 'pos' is negative, starts at 'arr[0]'.
 * If 'count' is 0, does nothing and returns 0.
 * If 'count' is negative, writes from 'arr' until it reaches the end of 'arr'.
 * If 'count' is positive, writes 'count' ints from arr.
 * Returns the number of 32b integers successfully written.

char32 GetChar();
 * Reads and returns the next character in the file.
 * Returns -1 if it fails; check 'EOF' and 'Error' to see why.

char32 PutChar(char32 c);
 * Writes 'c' to file.
 * Returns -1 if it fails; otherwise returns 'c'.

char32 UngetChar(char32 c);
 * Un-reads 'c' to the input stream.
 * Returns -1 if it fails; otherwise returns 'c'.
 * This is a READ operation, not a WRITE operation. The file will not actually be modified;
 *     but further read operations will find this as the next character to be read.
 * Useful if you read a character, then realize you don't want it.

long Pos;
 * Read-only.
 * This represents the current position in the file.
 * In binary modes ('Open()', 'Create()', or 'OpenMode()' including "b"), this is the number
 *     of bytes into the file, as a long; i.e. '10L' == 10 bytes.
 * In text modes ('OpenMode()' not including "b"),
 *     the numerical value may not be meaningful but can still be used to restore the position
 *     to the same position later using 'Seek()' (if there are characters put back using
 *     'UngetChar()' still pending of being read, the behavior is undefined).

bool Seek(long pos, bool from_current = false);
 * Moves the current position of the file.
 * 'pos' is a 32b value, where '1L' represents 1 byte; similar to 'Pos'.
 * If 'from_current' is true, it moves forward from the current position.
 * Otherwise, it moves so that 'Pos' is equal to 'pos'.
 * Using 'from_current'==true in a file open in text mode ('OpenMode()' not
 *     including "b") is undefined.
 * Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
 * If successful, this function has the following side-effects:
 *     All previous calls to 'UngetChar()' are dropped.
 *     The 'EOF' indicator is set to false.
 *     Allows switching between reading and writing on a read/write file.

void Rewind();
 * Rewinds to the beginning of the file.
 * This function has the following side-effects:
 *     All previous calls to 'UngetChar()' are dropped.
 *     The 'EOF' indicator is set to false.
 *     The 'Error' indicator is set to 0.
 *     Allows switching between reading and writing on a read/write file.

bool EOF;
 * Read-Only. Returns true if a read call attempted to read past the end of the file.
 * If true, no further read calls will succeed until the position has been changed;
 *     i.e. 'Seek()' or 'Rewind()'.

int Error;
 * Read-Only. Returns 0 if the file has not enountered an error.
 * If an error was encountered, returns an error code number.

void ClearError();
 * Clears the active EOF and Error indicators.
 * i.e. this writes 'EOF = false;' and 'Error = 0;'.

void GetError(char32[] buf);
 * Stores a string describing the current error into the buffer provided.
 * Stores an empty string if 'Error == 0'.

	* Sets the extend value for all of Link's various actions.
*/

void Warp(int DMap, int screen);
 * Warps link to the given screen in the given DMap, just like if he'd
 * triggered an 'Insta-Warp'-type warp.
 * Uses warp return square A, unless compat rule `Old 'Hero->Warp' Return Square' is on,
 *    in which case it uses the warp return square of the current screen's Sidewarp A.

void WarpEx(int ptr[])

* Similar to Link->Warp, but with more options. This takes an array, or
  an array literal as its arguments. 
  
  Valid array params are:
	Link->WarpEx({type,dmap,screen,x,y,effect,sound,flags})
	and
	Link->WarpEx({type,dmap,screen,x,y,effect,sound,flags,forcedir})

	type:
		WT_IWARP: Acts like a tile warp.
		WT_ENTRANCEEXIT: An entrance/exit warp.
		WT_SCROLLING: A scrolling warp.
			
	dmap:
		The Destination DMap
		
	screen: 
		The Destination Screen
		
	x, y:
		Either raw pixel coordinates, or a warp return square ID.
		
			Link->WarpEx() Coordinates Versus Warp Return Square:
				- If 'x' and 'y' are both > -1, then they are raw coordinates as always.
				- If 'x' < 0, THEN 'y' is the warp return square type, using positive integers.

					This allows using the warp return constants in std.zh, and it prevents a 
					possible ID clash from both values trying to establish the square ID. 
				- If BOTH are < 0, then it acts as a pitwarp (player stays in place)

	effect:
		Warp Effects are:
		WARPEFFECT_NONE: No visual effect.
		WARPEFFECT_ZAP: Zap Effects
		WARPEFFECT_WAVE: Wave Effects
		WARPEFFECT_INSTANT: Black screen.
		WARPEFFECT_OPENWIPE: Calls the opening wipe.

	sound:
		You may play a special sound (e.g. Magic Mirror) during the warp.

	flags:
		Warp Flags are:
		WARP_FLAG_SCRIPTDRAW: Don't kill script drawing during the warp.
		WARP_FLAG_PLAYSOUNDS: Don't kill playing sounds during the warp.
		WARP_FLAG_PLAYMUSIC: Don't kill playing music during the warp.
		WARP_FLAG_SETENTRANCESCREEN:
		WARP_FLAG_SETENTRANCEDMAP:
		WARP_FLAG_SETCONTINUESCREEN:
		WARP_FLAG_SETCONTINUEDMAP:
		These flags can be OR'd (|) together.

	forcedir:
		You can either accept the engine's setting for what Link's Dir should be
		after warping him, or force a dir.

int PitPullDir;
 * Returns the direction that the Hero is being pulled in by a pit
 * Read-only

int PitPullTimer;
 * A timer related to pits pulling the hero
 * The pit will only pull the hero on frames where 'PitPullTimer % PitSensitivity == 0'
 * The Pit Sensitivity is an attribyte on the pit combo
 * Read-Write

int Falling;
 * The timer indicating how long left the Hero will be falling
 * If 0, the Hero is not falling
 * Max value of 70, which is the value when you begin falling
 * Writing 'Hero->Action = LA_FALLING' is identical to setting this to 70.
 * Read-Write

int FallCombo;
 * The pit combo that the Hero is falling into
 * If non-zero, this combo's attributes will affect things such as if the Hero will warp,
 *     and how much damage they will take upon finishing falling.
 * If ==0, the Hero will take 1/4 heart of damage, and not warp
 * Writing 'Hero->Action = LA_FALLING' will overwrite this value
 * Writing to '->Falling' will overwrite this value
 * Read-Write

bool MoveFlags[2];
 * Flags relating to movement.
 * See 'HEROMV_' constants in std_constants.zh for values
 * [0] == Obeys gravity (see ->Gravity)
 * [1] == Can fall in pitfalls
 * Read-Write

float IceVx;
float IceVy;
 * The player's ice velocity (in pixels per frame).
 * Read/write, has no effect unless the player is Sliding.
 * If the player is not Sliding, the engine will clear these to '0'.

int IceEntryFrames;
int IceEntryMaxFrames;
 * Read/write, 0-255, has no effect unless the player is Sliding.
 * Used to grant the player some leeway when first entering the ice.
 * On entering the ice, these are set to the same value, and 'IceEntryFrames'
 *     then ticks down each frame to 0. Instantly goes to 0 if the player is still.
 * Based on the ratio between these values, the player's deceleration
 *     will be somewhere between the IceCombo's deceleration and half of the player's step speed.

int Sliding;
 * Read-only. One of the 'SLD_' constants:
 * SLD_NONE (0) - not sliding
 * SLD_ICE (1) - sliding on the ground, on ice
 * SLD_AIR (2) - sliding in the air (momentum from ice)

int IceCombo;
 * Read-only. The icy combo the player is sliding on.

int ScriptIceCombo;
 * Read-write. If nonzero, this combo is used instead of the IceCombo (can be used to force the player to slide).
 * If the specified combo is not an Icy Floor combo that affects the player, no sliding will occur.

void Free();
 * DEPRECATED: This no longer does anything - objects are freed automatically now.
 *             See "Object Memory Management" section
 * If the bitmap is allocated, frees the bitmap.
 *     This means that this bitmap ID is able to be returned by subsequent
 *     calls to 'Game->AllocateBitmap()' and such.
 * Note: The bitmap will remain allocated until script draws are next cleared.
 *       This generally occurs at the end of each frame, unless 'Game->Suspend[]'
 *       is used to prevent it.
 * Once the bitmap is freed, any image data on it is deleted.

void Own();
 * Requires an allocated bitmap.
 * Grants 'Ownership' of the bitmap to the currently running script.
 * [pre-3.0] When the script terminates (at the same time any Local Arrays in the script are cleared), the bitmap will be automatically freed.

bool isValid();
 * Returns true if the bitmap points to a valid bitmap
 * A bitmap is valid when it has been created, and can be written to
 * A bitmap returned from `Game->AllocateBitmap()` is NOT valid, until it is created.
 
bool isAllocated();
 * Returns true if the bitmap points to an allocated bitmap
 * A bitmap which has not been allocated should not be used, and should be allocated with `Game->AllocateBitmap()` or created with `Game->CreateBitmap()`

int GetPixel(int x, int y);
 * Returns the palette index value of a pixel on the current bitmap pointer.

void Create(int layer = 0, int width = 256, int height = 256);
 * Creates a bitmap on a bitmap pointer, with a size of height, width.
 * Destroys any existing bitmap on that pointer before creating a new one.
 * You can use this on an initialized bitmap pointer; either one allocated with 'Game->AllocateBitmap()', or a bitmap pointer that has a valid bitmap on it.
 * You can ALSO use this on an uninitialised pointer, and it will attempt to initialize it. The layer arg will be ignored when this is used on an uninitialised pointer.
 * Note: The 'layer' arg in this function is exclusively for ordering. This WILL NOT clear a specific 'layer' of a bitmap. Layers in ZC are only an expression of drawing order/sequence!
 
void Clear(int layer = 0);
 * Clears the bitmap to colour 0. 
 * Note: The 'layer' arg in this function is exclusively for ordering. This WILL NOT write out a specific 'layer' of a bitmap. Layers in ZC are only an expression of drawing order/sequence!
 
void ClearToColor(int layer, int color);
 * Clears the bitmap to the chosen color.
 * Note: The 'layer' arg in this function is exclusively for ordering. This WILL NOT write out a specific 'layer' of a bitmap. Layers in ZC are only an expression of drawing order/sequence!
 
void Read(int layer, char32[] filename);
 * Reads a valid graphic file into a bitmap pointer.
 * If used on an uninitialised pointer, it will first attempt to allocate it.
 *     If it fails to allocate the pointer, it will not attempt the read operation.
 * If the filename provided is invalid (e.g., the file is missing), the pointer
 * will be initialised with a blank bitmap at a size of 256x176.
 * If the quest rule "All bitmap-> and FileSystem-> paths relative to quest 'Files' folder" is on,
 *     then this will read a file relative to "[zc root]/Files/[quest name]/" instead of relative
 *     to "[zc root]".
 * Read() will fail if:
 *	The file is corrupt:
		PNG, JPEG, or other 'compressed' formats may abort if the file is corrupt.
 * 		Formats such as .BMP or .TGA may read up until missing data, as they are linear.
 * 	The file is missing.
 * 	The filename is incorrect. Remember that POSIX filesystems are Case-SenSitive. 
 
void Write(int layer, char32[] filename, bool allow_overwrite = false);
 * Writes a bitmap out as a graphic file.
 * This supports the following formats/extensions:
 *     .png, .gif, .pcx, .tgx, and .bmp. 
 * The provided filename string MUST include one of these extensions, as this
 *     both sets the output filetype, and validates the write.
 * Any other extension, or a lack of a valid extension will result in
 *     logging an error and failing to write the file.
 * Will not replace an existing file unless allow_overwrite is true.
 * Will fail on an uninitialised pointer.
 * Will create any missing directories on the path.
 * Note: The 'layer' arg in this function is exclusively for ordering. 
 *       This WILL NOT write out a specific 'layer' of a bitmap.
 *        Layers in ZC are only an expression of drawing order/sequence!
 * If the quest rule "All bitmap-> and FileSystem-> paths relative to quest 'Files' folder" is on,
 *     then this will write a file relative to "[zc root]/Files/[quest name]/" instead of relative
 *     to "[zc root]".
 * Remember that POSIX filesystems are Case-SenSitive. 

void WriteTile( int layer, int x, int y, int tile, bool is8bit = true, bool mask = false);
 * Writes a 16x16 area from (x,y) of the bitmap at layer 'layer' 
 *     TO the tile page, overwriting the tile 'tile', either 4 or 8 bit.
 * If 'mask' is true, overlays instead of overwrites

void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color );
 * Draws 'color' to the bitmap, on any pixels that are non-color-0 on the mask.
 * The mask's `0,0` is overlayed at `0,0` of the destination.
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int maskColor );
 * Same as above, but instead of any non-0 pixels, pixels that match 'maskColor' are used
void MaskedDraw( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as above, but colors c such that 'startMaskColor <= c <= endMaskColor' will be used as the mask.

void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int maskColor );
void MaskedBlit( int layer, bitmap mask, bitmap pattern, bool repeatPattern, int startMaskColor, int endMaskColor );
 * Same as 'MaskedDraw', but instead of drawing a color to the masked portions, draws from
 * a supplied 'pattern' bitmap.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is false, the pattern will be drawn at `0,0` with the width/height of the pattern bitmap, and nowhere else.
 * If 'repeatPattern' is true, the pattern will repeat in a tiled manner, starting from `0,0`, up to the width/height of the destination bitmap.
 * 'repeatPattern' does not affect the mask bitmap.

void Dither( int layer, bitmap mask, int color, int ditherType, int ditherArg )
 * Draws 'color' to the bitmap, using a dithering pattern, only on pixels that are
 * non-color-0 on the mask bitmap.
 * Use 'DITH_' constants from std_constants.zh for 'ditherType'.

void ReplaceColors( int layer, int color, int startCol, int endCol )
 * Replaces colors >= startCol and <= endCol with 'color'
 
void ShiftColors( int layer, int shift, int startCol, int endCol )
 * Adds 'shift' to colors >= startCol and <= endCol

int CountColor(bitmap mask, int x, int y, int checkColor, int maskColor = -1);
 * Checks the area of the bitmap specified by the mask for the specified 'checkColor', returning how many pixels match.
 * If 'maskColor' is '-1', any non-0 portion of the mask bitmap will be checked. Otherwise, only areas of the mask bitmap that match the maskColor will be checked.
 * The area checked is from `x,y` to `x+mask->Width,y+mask->Height`. If this goes out of bounds, the out of bounds area is ignored.
 * As this is not a drawing function, draws that occur this frame will *NOT* be read-only whatever was drawn to the bitmap at the end of the previous frame will (similar to GetPixel())

void Blit(int layer, bitmap target,
		int source_x, int source_y, int source_w, int source_h,

bool Testing;
 * Returns true if this instance of ZC was launched from the 'Quest->Test' option in ZQ.

void Breakpoint(char[] string = NULL);
 * If the ZASM debugger is open, this will break execution, and print the given string.
 * Break controls:
 *     'Insert' - break, or step forward if broken
 *     'Shift+Insert' - Step forward until next breakpoint, or start of next script, whichever comes first
 *     'Ctrl+Shift+Insert' - Same as above, but, doesn't print any ZASM until it breaks.
 *     'Alt+Insert' - Step forward until next breakpoint
 *     'Ctrl+Alt+Insert' - Same as above, but, doesn't print any ZASM until it breaks.
 *     'Ctrl+Insert' - Exit the ZASM debugger entirely
 * If the ZASM debugger is not open, this instruction does NOTHING.
 * Passing NULL to this function will not produce an error, instead printing no label
 * In ZASM scripts, passing the 'NUL' register to this instruction will not produce an error, instead printing no label

float D[256];
 * This is the value of the ri->d[] registers. 
 * These vary depending on the function, or the instruction.
 * For variable access, SETTER: ri->d[0] is the value being passed to the variable.
 * For variable access, GETTER: ri->d[0] *MIGHT BE* the value read from ther variable. (Need to verify.)
 * For array access, SETTER: ri->d[0] is the array index, and ri->d[1] is the value.
 * For array access, GETTER: ri->d[0] is the array index. Not sure on the RVal at this time.

 * For functions, ri->d[n] are the args passed to the functions.
 * 	Typically, the order is ri->d[0] for the first parameter, and each additional param is one index higher.
 *	Some functions might pop values in weird ways. 
 *	It should be possible to purely write functions as SETTER and GETTER types, so that their params
 * 	are simply the ri->d[] values, in order. 

 * Script drawing commands use sdci[] (&script_drawing_commands[n1][n2]), which is different.
 * Their params should still be available via ri->d[], but some values, may not. 
 * 	The frirst param for any script drawing instruction is the BITMAP that it uses. 
 * 	For bitmap-> pointer drawing commands, the bitmap ID is ri->bitmapref, set by Game->LoadBitmapID().
 * 	Otherwise, the BITMAP pointer is set by SetRenderTarget(), qand held in sdci[18].
 *	The other params follow, as inputs from the instruction (function params passed to it).
 *	last, the playfield offsets typically follow the function params.
 * 	Of these, on;y the sdci[] values would be available to ri->d[], if nothing eats them beforehand.

===================================
INTRODUCTION
===================================

  ASE (Allegro Sprite Editor) is an open source program to create
  animated sprites. Sprites are little images that can be used in your
  website or in a video game. You can draw characters with movement,
  intros, textures, patterns, backgrounds, logos, color palettes,
  isometric levels, etc.

  What makes ASE different? It focuses on pixel editing, to do
  pixel-art. Indeed, it isn't a photo retouching tool or a vector
  graphics editor. Mainly it is a tool to create tiny animations
  pixel-by-pixel.

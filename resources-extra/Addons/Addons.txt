--AntiMicro--
This utility allows configuring joypads/joysticks that have buttons
beyond what ZC Player is capable of reading, such as the XBoxOne and
the XBox360 controllers.

--DXGL--
This is a replacement for the DirectX and DirectDraw libraries that
fixes drawing issues when using ZC on newer hardware, Windows10,
and some video card drivers, by converting DX output to OpenGL.

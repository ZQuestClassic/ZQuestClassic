; comparisons, if-short-circuiting across blocks (1)
; From bumper.zplay:
;    if(Distance(CenterX(this), CenterY(this), CenterLinkX(), CenterLinkY())<this->TileWidth*8+2&&Link->Z==0){
; (but w/o the function call)
;
; This ZASM does short circuiting logic. Each segment jumps to a common node upon failure, before it then jumps to
; the block following the non-true edge of the conditional.
; It is rewritten to jump directly to the final block, as long as there are no side effects it would skip.

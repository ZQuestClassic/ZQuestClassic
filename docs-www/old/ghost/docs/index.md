# ghost.zh

ghost.zh is used to create "ghosted enemy" FFC scripts. These combine an FFC
and a built-in enemy to create what seems to be a scripted enemy. The enemy
handles collision detection, defense. The FFC runs the script and,typically,
is what is actually visible on the screen.

Most of this documentation is meant for users who want to write scripts.
If you just want to use existing enemy scripts, see [this page](autoGhost.md).

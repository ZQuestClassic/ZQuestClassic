            "text": "You'll have to set some constants in ghost.zh. Open it in a text editor. Use\na basic one, like Notepad; more advanced word processors sometimes modify\npunctuation marks, which can make scripts unusable.  The constants look similar to this:  const int CONSTANT_NAME = ###; // And sometimes there's a note here  The ### part is what you need to change. Be careful to leave the semicolon in place.   These are the standard settings:   GH_SHADOW_TILE  GH_SHADOW_CSET  GH_SHADOW_FRAMES  GH_SHADOW_ANIM_SPEED  GH_SHADOW_TRANSLUCENT  GH_SHADOW_FLICKER  If a shadow needs to be drawn by the script, it will use these settings.\nIf you want shadows to have multiple frames, they must be consecutive tiles,\nand  GH_SHADOW_TILE  should be the number of the first one. For the\ntranslucency and flickering settings, set the number to 1 (yes) or 0 (no).  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_TILE  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_CSET  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_FRAMES  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_ANIM_SPEED  Large enemies may have 2x2 tile shadows using these settings. This only\napplies when built-in shadows are not used. This is the case only if GH_PREFER_GHOST_ZH_SHADOWS  or  GH_FAKE_Z  are used or if a specific enemy\nuses fake Z movement. If  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_TILE  is 0, large shadows will never\nbe used.  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_MIN_WIDTH  GH_LARGE_SHADOW_MIN_HEIGHT  An enemy must be at least this large in tiles to have a large shadow.\nThese are tile sizes; set them between 1 and 4.  GH_PREFER_GHOST_ZH_SHADOWS  ghost.zh's shadows will be used instead of built-in ones whenever possible.\nSet the number to 1 (yes) or 0 (no).  AUTOGHOST_MIN_FFC  AUTOGHOST_MAX_FFC   Every scripted enemy uses at least one FFC. Set these to limit the range of\nFFCs they will use automatically. Use these if you want to reserve some FFCs\nfor other purposes. Both must be between 1 and 32.   Attention  If all FFCs in this range are in use when an enemy appears, the script\nwon't be able to run, so you shouldn't limit the range more than necessary.    AUTOGHOST_MIN_ENEMY_ID  AUTOGHOST_MAX_ENEMY_ID  These allow you to limit the range of enemy IDs that can be set up\nautomatically by AutoGhost. Any enemy whose ID is below the minimum or\nabove the maximum will be ignored. This is useful when other scripts use\nmisc. attributes 11 and 12 for other purposes.  GH_DRAW_OVER_THRESHOLD  Some scripts set the FFC's  Draw Over  flag automatically as the enemy moves\nup and down. This determines the Z value at which it changes. This is similar\nto the setting  Jumping Sprite Layer Threshold  in the quest's initialization data.  GH_GRAVITY  GH_TERMINAL_VELOCITY  These should match the numbers set for gravity and terminal velocity in\nthe initialization data.  GH_SPAWN_SPRITE  This is the number of the sprite used by spawningenemies, found in Quest > Graphics > Sprites > Weapons/Misc.  Scripted enemies don't use\nthe normal spawn animations. This sprite is used to fake it. If you use\nthe default sprite, 22, make sure its animation frames and speed are set.  GH_FAKE_Z  If enabled, enemies won't move through the Z axis. Similar to unchecking the\nquest rule  Enemies Jump/Fly Through Z-Axis . Set this to 1 (yes) or 0 (no).  __GH_FAKE_EWEAPON_Z  The same, but for weapons. Set this to 1 (yes) or 0 (no).  GH_ENEMIES_FLICKER  If enabled, enemies will flicker instead of flashing. Similar to checking\nthe quest rule  Enemies Flicker When Hit . Set this to 1 (yes) or 0 (no).  GH_BLANK_TILE  Set this to the tile number of the top-left of your 4x4 block of blank tiles.  GH_INVISIBLE_COMBO  Set this to the number of the combo that uses the blank tile.  __GH_ALWAYS_USE_NAME  If this is set to 0, the enemy's script and combo will be taken from misc.\nattributes 11 and 12. If it's set to 1, they'll be read from the name,\nfreeing up those attributes for other scripts to use. See the section\non setting up the script and combo below for more details.   __GH_CLEAR_FFC_LINK  If this is set to 1, the ffc->Link value will clear when ghost.zh cleans\nup the script. ZC 2.50.2 and earlier do not support this as it is not legal\nto write ffc->Link = 0, however 2.53.0 and later support clearing linked ffcs.\nSet this to 0 to disable clearing it.  __GH_ETHEREAL  If this is set to 1, then autoghost enemies will set their controlling ffc\nto use the Ethereal flag. This ensures that the ffc does not override the properties\nof the normal screen comno, or any other ffc underneath it. Set this to 0 if you\nare using legacy scripts that are incompatible with this option.  __GH_FIX_EWM_FALL  This is a bugfix setting that prevents inappropriate removal of falling weapons\non sideview screens.\nSet this to 0 if you are using legacy scripts that are incompatible with this option.  __GH_FIX_EWM_THROW  This is a bugfix setting that prevents inappropriate removal of thrown weapons\non sideview screens.\nSet this to 0 if you are using legacy scripts that are incompatible with this option.  __GH_WEAPONS_HIT_PLATFORMS  If this is set to 1, then weapons thrown or falling on sideview screens, that are\ncontrolled by ghost.zh, will die when they strike solid combos (e.g. sideview platforms).\nSet this to 0 if you are using legacy scripts that are incompatible with this option.\nThis relies on  __GH_FIX_EWM_FALL  and  __GH_FIX_EWM_THROW  .  If you're making multiple quests at once that use different settings, you\nshould use a different copy of ghost.zh for each one. You only need to copy\nghost.zh itself, not the ghost_zh folder.",

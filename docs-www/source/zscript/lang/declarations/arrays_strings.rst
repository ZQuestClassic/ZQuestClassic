Arrays / Strings
================

Arrays store multiple values in one variable.

Declaring Arrays
----------------

To declare a new array, you declare it as you would a variable, with `[]` included
after the variable name. You can either specify the size of the array as a |ctc|
inside the `[]`, or you can allow it to automatically determine the size based
on its initializer. You can also specify the `[]` as part of the variable type,
although if you do this, you cannot specify a size between them.

The ``type`` of the array will be an *array type*- unique from the normal type.
You cannot assign an array to a normally-typed variable. You can, however, declare
array-type variables the same way as declaring arrays- specify `[]` in the type.
(You *cannot* specify the `[]` after the variable name for this use case)

.. danger::
	You technically *CAN* assign an array to a normally-typed variable,
	for compatibility reasons- this fires a compiler **warning**, rather
	than a compiler **error**.

	It is recommended to change the :ref:`compiler option<zslang_options>`
	:zs_meta:`LEGACY_ARRAYS` to `off`, which will cause these to become
	full compiler errors.

	If using arrays of types involved in :ref:`memory management<gc>`,
	you **must** properly use array types, or your objects may be prematurely deleted.

.. _array_literals:

Array Literals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An array literal is a comma-delimited list of values, inside `{}`, used to denote
the starting values of an array. It can be used directly, ex. passed to functions,
acting as a ``temporary value``, which cannot be stored. Alternately, it can
be used as the initializer of an array, storing it for longer-term use.

.. note::
	If an array literal is used **NOT as the initailizer for an array**,
	it will attempt to automatically determine what type it should be
	and what size it should be based on the elements of the array.

	You may, however, specify a type and size in parentheses before
	the array literal, ex. `some_func((int[5]){1,2,3});`

	Using the `auto` type can allow you to specify a size, while still
	allowing the type to be automatically determined. You can also
	specify a type, but leave the `[]` empty to automatically determine
	the size.

.. tab-set::

	.. tab-item:: Basic

		.. zscript::
			:style: body

			int arr[5]; // an array of 5 integers. All default to '0'.
			int arr2[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // an array of 5 integers, 1-5.
			int arr3[5] = {10, 20}; // an array of 5 integers; 10, 20, and 3 '0's.
			
			int x = 2;
			<error>int arr4[x];</error> // 'Error T046: An expression is not constant that needs to be.'
		
	.. tab-item:: Typing

		.. zscript::
			:style: body

			int arr[5];
			<warn>int x = arr;</warn> // 'Warning S108: Array mismatch for types int[] and int'
			// This should be avoided. You can do this instead:
			int[] y = arr; // no warning, variable is declared as an array type

		Prior to 3.0, you cannot put an array initializer inside an array initializer to initialize multiple levels of array.

		Since 3.0 this has been allowed.

		.. zscript::
			:style: body

			// Wrong
			int[] arr[] = { <error>{1, 2}</error>, <error>{3, 4}</error> }; // Error T100: Temporary literals cannot be stored

			// Right
			int _a[] = {1, 2};
			int _b[] = {3, 4};
			int[] arr[] = {_a, _b};

Accessing Arrays
----------------

An array can be accessed using `int` indexes, starting at `0`, using
the index operator `[]`. You may also iterate over every value in
an array using a :ref:`for-each<stmt_for_each>` loop.

Additionally, you may access an array using *negative* indexes. These
will access the array *backwards*, ex. `arr[-1]` will access the
*last* element in the array `arr`. This currently does not work for internal arrays (such as :ref:`Screen->D[]<globals_screen_var_d>`).

.. tab-set::

	.. tab-item:: Direct Access

		.. zscript::
			:style: body

			int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};

			Trace(arr[0]); // outputs '1.0000'
			Trace(arr[-1]); // outputs '5.0000'

			// What isn't ok (runtime errors, not compile errors):
			<error>Trace(arr[5]);</error> // 'Invalid index (5) to local array of size 5', and outputs '-1.0000'
			<error>Trace(arr[-6]);</error> // 'Invalid index (-6) to local array of size 5', and outputs '-1.0000'

	.. tab-item:: For-Each Access

		.. zscript::
			:style: body
			
			for(num : arr)
				Trace(num);
			/* Outputs:
			1.0000
			2.0000
			3.0000
			4.0000
			5.0000
			*/

.. _strings:

Strings
-------

A 'String' is a special name for arrays of the `char32` type, which hold
character data (text). They are identical to arrays in every way, because,
well, they *are* arrays- but, notably, they have their own special
initializer you can use.

.. _string_literals:

String Literals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A string literal represents an array of multiple character values. It is represented
as multiple characters, between two double-quotes (ex. `"apple"`).

Additionally, :ref:`escape characters<escape_characters>` can be used to insert
special characters, including `"` and `\\`.

Also, adjacent strings are automatically merged by the compiler. Ex:

.. zscript::
	:style: body
	
	printf("This is a string"
		" split across multiple lines!\n");
	// prints 'This is a string split across multiple lines!'

Temporary array values
----------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
	Since 3.0, arrays are managed by :ref:`the garbage collector<gc>`, and so do
	not have these restrictions for array literals.

Prior to 3.0, array/string literals create what is known as a ``temporary value``, which cannot be
stored in a variable- its primary purpose is to pass directly into functions.
However, a string literal can also be used as the initializer for a `char32` array,
which does store it for longer-term use.

.. zscript::
	:style: body

	char32 str[] = "Test String\n";
	printf(str); // outputs 'Test String'

	char32[] strs[] = { <error>"Test 1"</error>, <error>"Test 2"</error> }; // Error T100: Temporary literals cannot be stored

.. note::
	:ref:`'#include' statements<directive_import>` use a special form of
	string literal with slightly different rules (notably, not using escape
	characters)

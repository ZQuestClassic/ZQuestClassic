Identifiers
===========

Most declarations require at least one ``identifier``. An identifier is a set of
characters that only contains `'a'`-`'z'`, `'A'`-`'Z'`, `'0'`-`'9'`, and `'_'`.
Identifiers may not **begin** with a number. Identifiers are case-sensitive.

Usually these are used to name whatever it is you are declaring.

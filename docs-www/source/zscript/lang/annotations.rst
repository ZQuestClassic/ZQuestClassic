.. _annotations:

Annotations allow setting specific metadata and settings related to single
statements. For example, an annotation might be set on a script to indicate
the author, or set on an `enum` to indicate how much the constants inside
should increment by.

Individual annotations will be explained on the pages they are relevant to.
Below is a list of such pages:

- :ref:`Enums<enum_annotations>`
- :ref:`Smart Loops<loop_annotations>`
- :ref:`Scripts<zslang_scripts>`

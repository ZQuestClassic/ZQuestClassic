We currently have no recent tutorials for how to use the editor, but there are many old ones. Many features have been added since these were written; UI would have changed, and perhaps better approaches for some things exist now. If you need more recent advice, `just reach out <https://zquestclassic.com/community/>`_!

For now, some recent (but mostly pretty old) tutorials can be found here:

* `PureZC Tutorials <https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showforum=152>`_
* `Wiki Archive <https://web.archive.org/web/20210910193102/https://zeldaclassic.com/wiki>`_

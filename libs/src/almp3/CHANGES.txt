Changes
-------

 v2.0.5
  - Added some little tests so it won't crash when reading (after seeking)
    from some badly encoded MP3s.

 v2.0.4
  - Avoid errors to popup while playing an MP3 or converting to a SAMPLE
    if the error was found on the last frame. Thanks goes to Bruno Dupuis
    for fixing it.

 v2.0.3
  - Improved the error tolerance of ALMP3_MP3s. It should be as good as the
    ALMP3_MP3STREAMs one now. Thanks to Eduardo Machado for pointing this
    out.

 v2.0.2
  - Added some lacking definitions to the header file and deleted some
    that never existed
  - Fixed some little bugs and typos

 v2.0.1
  - Fixed a small bug where the MP3s would sound with static if their
    volume was too loud

 v2.0.0
  - Changed the mp3 decoder to the mpglib of mpg123-pre0.59s, it should
    be faster and is LGPLed unlike Xing's decoder, that was GPLed
  - Changed the version scheme, now it uses x.y.z being 'x' used for big
    changes, 'y' used for normal changes and 'z' for small changes like
    bugfixes
  - Removed the almp3_create_mp3_ex() and almp3_create_mp3stream_ex() since
    the new decoder doesn't support (as far as I know) downmixing and
    downsampling, but it should be faster than the old one though

 v1.9
  - Fixed a little typo in the header pointed out by Henrik Schmidt
  - Changed the license to the Xing MP3 decoder real license, that is
    GPL. Looks like the lib I downloaded had by error the LGPL license
    file in its folder where the GPL should had been, they changed it
    recently and I didn't find it out till today. Version 2.0.0 should
    be LPGLed again, thanks to the mpglib of mpg123 (used for example
    in XMMS)

 v1.8
  - Added options to create the lib as a DLL, please read the README.txt
    file again for further instructions. Deleted the ML and MT models in
    MSVC, since this lib needs Allegro and Allegro is only built in MD
    mode
  - Added a notice about LGPL license restrictions and how to avoid them
    using the DLL version of the library

 v1.71
  - Changed a bit more the makefile because of compability issues with
    gcc 3.0.x (now the "underwater" sounding should be totally gone)

 v1.7
  - Changed the makefile to make it compatible with gcc 3.0.x (all the
    "underwater" sounding should be fixed now)

 v1.6
  - Major change on the API (added the 'almp3_'and "ALMP3_" prefixes to
    every function and type the library uses) to avoid name crashes.
    Also changed some functions names for a better name.
  - Some mp3stream bugfixes and feedback by David Dribin.
  - Added functions to seek and get the pos and length in bytes for both
    mp3s and mp3streams as suggested by Dave Dribin.
  - Alexey V. Medvedev suggested a function to make possible downmixing
    (stereo to mono) and downsampling for less powerful computers.
    Functions create_mp3_ex() and create_mp3stream_ex() added for this
    purpose.
  - Changes on the makefiles and directory structure to be able to
    compile for several platforms using the same directory.
  - Added mp3stream_get_audiostream() and mp3_get_audiostream() as
    suggested by Connelly Barnes.
  - Fixed some "staticness" in some functions.
  - Added some functions to mp3streams to get information when seeking
    (read carefully their docs, they are not like mp3 seek ones).

 v1.5
  - Nick Sumner found a BIG bug on the play_mp3 and play_mp3_ex functions
    that prevented mp3s (not mp3streams) from being played!
  - Other minor bugfixes
  - Added options in the MSVC project to make able the lib to be compiled
    as Single-Threaded (ML), Multi-Threaded (MT) or Multi-Threaded DLL (MD)

 v1.4
  - Added mp3_is_looping() and mp3_set_loop()
  - Added a function to calculate the length of an MP3STREAM
  - Added the function mp3_is_playing() and mp3stream_is_playing()
  - Fixed (again) the MSVC project files


 v1.3
  - Fixed some bugs reported by Troy D Patterson
  - Added adjust_mp3 and adjust_mp3stream to the headers (thanks to
    Chris Jones for pointing it out)
  - Fixed bugs affecting very small mp3s reported by Chris Graham
  - Fixed more bugs in the example program
  - Chris Graham fixed the MSVC example project file


 v1.2
  - Added some functions to retrieve the decoded data.
  - Changes on the streaming API (sorry!) because the old one had serious
    design flaws
  - Gillius added a port for Microsoft Visual C++
  - Gillius fixed a little bug in the example
  - Some minor bugfixes
  - New functions to change the parameters of the MP3 meanwhile it is
    playing (adjust_mp3(), adjust_mp3stream())
  - New functions to get mp3 info like mp3_get_wave_is_stereo() or
    mp3_get_wave_freq()
  - Now the lib is able to load an mp3 into a SAMPLE (suggestion by
    Chris Graham)
  - Peter Wang did a change of format in fixunix.sh
  - Eric Botcazou suggested a change in the buffer size of the examples


 v1.1
  - First public release

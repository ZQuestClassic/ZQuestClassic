Feat: Added Link->WarpEx(int ptr[])

Changelog: Added Link->WarpEx(int ptr[])

This takes an array as its args, sized as either 8 or 9!

Valid array params are:
Link->WarpEx({type,dmap,screen,x,y,effect,sound,flags})
and
Link->WarpEx({type,dmap,screen,x,y,effect,sound,flags,forcedir}

type:
	Warp types are:
		wtIWARP: Acts like a tile warp.
		wtExit: An entrance/exit warp.
		wtSCROLL: A scrolling warp.
		wtNONE: A cancel warp.

dmap:
	The Destination DMap

screen:
	The Destination Screen

x, y:
	Either raw pixel coordinates, or a warp return square ID.

		Link->WarpEx() Coordinates Versus Warp Return Square:
			If 'x' and 'y' are both > -1, then they are raw coordinates as always.
			If 'x' < 0, THEN 'y' is the warp return square type, using positive integers.

			This allows using the warp return constants in std.zh, and it prevents a
			possible ID clash from both values trying to establish the square ID.

effect:
	Warp Effects are:
	warpEffectNONE: No visual effect.
	warpEffectZap: Zap Effects
	warpEffectWave: Wave Effects
	warpEffectInstant: Black screen.
	warpEffectOpen: Calls the opening wipe.

sound:
	You may play a special sound (e.g. Magic Mirror) during the warp.

flags:
	Warp Flags are:
	warpFlagKILLSCRIPTDRAWS: Don't kill script drawing during the warp.
	warpFlagKILLSOUNDS: Don't kill playing sounds during the warp.
	warpFlagKILLMUSIC: Don't kill playing music during the warp.

	Their values are:
	warpFlagKILLSCRIPTDRAWS 0x01
	warpFlagKILLSOUNDS 0x02
	warpFlagKILLMUSIC 0x04

	Add them together to calculate a flag.

forcedir:
	You can either accept the engine's setting for what Link's Dir should be
	after warping him, or force a dir.

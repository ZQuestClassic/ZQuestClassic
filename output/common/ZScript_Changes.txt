2.53.1 ZScript Changes
10th January, 2020

The following ZScript instructons have been changed, or added
to ZC v2.53.1.

Some behaviour may differ if the player uses a quest with these
insrtrcutions in an older version of ZC Player.

This document detals the new/revised instructions and the ramificatons
of using them in older ZC Player versions.

You may use Version.zh to check for ZC version 2.5301 to validate that
the player is using ZC Player 2.53.1, or higher.

bool IsValidArray(int ptr);		ZASM Instruction: 
					ISVALIDARRAY
/**
* Returns true if the int passed to 'ptr; is a valid array.
* Otherise, returns false.
* Works only it int/float array types.

int Version;				ZASM Instruction: 
					ZELDAVERSION
/**
* Returns the version of ZC Player being used to run the quest.
*	(!) This command requires ZC Player 2.53.0 Release 1, or later.
*	(!) Plaing a 2.53.x quest that uses this command in an earler version
*	(!) of ZC Player, will return 0.

int GetRenderTarget();
					
					ZASM Instruction: 
					GETRENDERTARGET
/**
* Returns the ID of the current Screen Render Target

int Attributes[];			ZASM Instruction: 
					NPCDD
/**
* The npc's Miscellaneous Attributes, as an array of fifteen integers.
* As of 2.53.0 Release 3, these are read/write.
* In older versions are read-only and sized to ten integers.
* Playing a quest that writes to them in an older version of

int Equipment;				ZASM Instruction: 
					LINKEQUIP
				
/**
* Contains the item IDs of what is currently equiped to Link's A and B buttons.
* The first 8 bits contain the A button item, and the second 8 bits contain the B button item.
* As of 2.53.0 Release 3, this are read/write but in older versions this is read-only.

* If you are not comfortable with performing binary operations,
* you can use the functions GetEquipmentA(), GetEquipmentB(), and SetEquipment(int  int b) in std.zh.

/// New Tokens ///
//////////////////

#include
This is similar in function in 2.53.1 to 'import', however as '#include' is now standardised in 2.55, 
we have included a simplified version of this directive in 2.53.1, to aid in transition from using
the 'import' directive, to the '#include' directive.

Files included with #include are read in the order of ./include, ./headers, ./scripts, <root>.
Files included with the import directive are read in the order of <root>, ./include, ./headers, ./scripts,
preserving the 2.50 ordering.

//General-Use Arrays with Getter/Setter functions

//A generic array, pre-included with all quests. 
//float stdArray[4096]; //This should be called GlobalRAM[]
int std_zh___GlobalRAM[4096];

//! Because this is the first global array that will likely be declared, called from the 'import "std.zh"' 
//! directive in scripts, or from the buffer; as the import directive for std.zh is usually the very first
//! instruction in any compilation attempt; this array will automatically have the highest numbered pointer.
//! This means that if it is added after a quest is made, it will be unavailable for use in existing SAVES
//! but it will not change the ordering of other arrays, or variables. 
//! 
//! Thus, running the quest on an old SAVE will NOT break anything, but it allows a quest developer who uses
//! this feature FROM THE ONSET, before releasing a agme, to EASILY go back in, and add global values EVEN
//! after releasing a quest, and with people playing it, WITHOUT invalidating their saved games; and it 
//! WILL allow them to use the new variables. 
//! 
//! It's essentially a catch-all for questmakers, as a way to later expand a quest, without breaking player
//! save files, or requiring them to start from scratch, to play the update.
